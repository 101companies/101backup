== Headline ==
a simple ruby implementation

== Motivation ==
We make use of the Ruby Development Tools plug-in for Eclipse:
http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/os-rubyeclipse/

We use a simple object model for companies.
These are plain ruby objects plus instance methods for some of the scenarios.
See the tests package for test cases.
