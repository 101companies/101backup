Illustration of the Template design pattern in [[Language:Java]]
== Characteristics ==

We identify templates for queries and transformations over companies.
We instantiate those templates for totaling and cutting salaries.
== Illustration ==

The data model is implemented with object composition. For example Companies:

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/model/Company.java/class/Company"/>

[[Feature:Closed serialization]] is implemented using [[Language:Java]] [[Technology:Object Streams]]:

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Serialization.java/class/Serialization/method/deserializeCompany"/>

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Serialization.java/class/Serialization/method/serializeCompany"/>

[[Feature:Total]] is implemented as a Reducer (query):

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Total.java/class/Total"/>

[[Feature:Cut]] is implemented as a Walker (transformation):

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Cut.java/class/Cut"/>

Test cases are implemented for all [[Namespace:Feature]]s.

== Architecture ==

The contribution follows a standardized structure:
* inputs contains input files for tests
* src/main/java contains the following packages:
** org.softlang.company.features for implementations of [[Functional requirements]].
** org.softlang.company.features.template for query and transformation patterns.
** org.softlang.company.model for implementations of [[Feature:Company]].
* src/test/java contains the following packages:
** org.softlang.company.tests for [[Technology:JUnit]] test cases for [[Namespace:Feature]]s.
== Usage ==

This contribution uses [[Technology:Gradle]] for building. [[Technology:Eclipse]] is supported.
