Multithreading in [[Language:Java]]
== Characteristics ==

Multithreading enables parallel or concurrent data processing for the implementation of functional requirements of the [[@system]].
== Illustration ==

The data model is implemented as [[POJO]]s, as usual. A sequential implementation of the operations for totaling and cutting salaries is also included. For instance:

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/model/Company.java/class/Company"/>

Concurrent computations rely on the identification of actions suitable for multithreading. Department-level actions for totaling and cutting salaries are chosen as the scope here. The following context class shows how an action is not performed sequentially but rather by submission to a thread pool.

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/context/ConcurrentContext.java/class/ConcurrentContext"/>
== Architecture ==

The contribution follows a standardized structure:
* inputs contains input files for tests
* src/main/java contains the following packages:
** org.softlang.company.features for implementations of [[functional requirement]]s.
*** org.softlang.company.features.action for helper classes for [[Feature:Total]] and [[Feature:Cut]].
*** org.softlang.company.features.context for helper classes for Multithreading.
** org.softlang.company.model for implementations of [[Feature:Company]].
* src/test/java contains the following packages:
** org.softlang.company.tests for [[Technology:JUnit]] test cases.
== Usage ==

This contribution uses [[Technology:Gradle]] for building. [[Technology:Eclipse]] is supported.
