Add day of birth for employees

== Description ==

The data structure shall be extended by introducing day of birth for employee.

== Motivation ==

The current data structure of [[Contribution:mySqlMany]] and [[Contribution:mySqlOne]] only allows two-dimensional aggregation and analysis of data. Adding [[Feature:Gender]] enables us aggregating data multi-dimensional and therefore creating a more advanced reporting commonly used in the area of Business Intelligence (i.e. OLAP cubes).

== Relationships ==

* See [[Contribution:mySqlOneReporting]] for an implementation of this feature
* The present feature should be applicable to any data model of companies, specifically [[Feature:Flat company]] and [[Feature:Hierarchical_company]].

== Metadata ==


* [[isA::Data requirement]]
