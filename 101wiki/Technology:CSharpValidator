A validator for [[Language:CSharp]]

== Description ==

CSharpValidator is a [[@technology]]; it is a C#-specific validator. CSharpValidator essentially parses the source code; it does not attempt compilation; it does not enforce any static semantics rules. Zero exit code is to be interpreted as successful validation; non-zero exit code as failure.

== Usage ==

To build and execute the validator, you need to have Mono SDK (2.10 +) installed.
Use 'make build' to build the project.
