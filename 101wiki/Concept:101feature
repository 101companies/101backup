A feature of the [[@system]]

== Description ==

The feature set could be subdivided in a classic manner into functional and non-functional requirements. Instead, a richer categorization is applied such that structure-related, behavior-related, quality-like, and ui-related features are distinguished. A special sub-category of feature concerns tool development and demonstration.
