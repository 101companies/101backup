The Linked Data access point of the [[@project]]
== Description ==

Various data is synthesized from the [[@repo]] and the [[@wiki]]. All such data is provide online through [[@data]], more specifically through the following link:

http://data.101companies.org

The synthesis of all such data is coordinated by the [[@worker]] which executes various [[@module]]s. The data may be conveniently explored (discovered) with the [[@explorer]]. The data is organized in a way that applies Linked Data principles. In particular, both dumps and smaller slices are provided. JSON is used as the primary format for outputs of [[@module]]s, but RDF is also supported increasingly.

A systematic documentation effort is underway for [[Namespace:Module]].
