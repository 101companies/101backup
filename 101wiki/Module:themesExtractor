Resolving of metadata and contributions
== Description ==

This module creates several files per theme and a folder for each theme having its name.

=== members.json ===

This is a list of theme members with some info per member.

Physically, this is a JSON array where each entry is a JSON object as follows:

* key = name; value = name of the contribution.
* key = headline; value = headline for the contribution as shown on 101wiki.
* key = features; value = number of features implemented by the contribution; see "implements".
* key = ufeatures; value = unique features, i.e., features not implemented by any other contribution in the given theme.
* key = languages; value = number of languages used by the contribution; see "uses".
* key = ulanguages; value = unique languages, i.e., languages not used by any other contribution in the given theme.
* key = technologies; value = number of technologies used by the contribution; see "uses".
* key = utechnologies; value = unique technologies, i.e., technologies not used by any other contribution in the given theme.
* key = concepts; value = number of concepts referenced by the contribution
* key = uconcepts; value = unique concepts

=== concepts.json ===

Conceptually, this is a list of referenced concepts (see above) with some info per concepts.

Physically, this is a JSON array where each entry is a JSON object as follows:

* key = name; value = name of the concept referenced by any member of the theme.
* key = headline; value = headline for the concept as shown on 101wiki.
* key = contributions; value = number of contribution pages referring to the concept.
* key = resolved; value = a boolean saying whether the concept page has a [[identifies::...]]

=== features.json ===

Very much like concepts.json but for "implemented features" instead of "referenced concepts".

=== languages.json ===

Very much like concepts.json but for "used languages" instead of "referenced concepts".

=== technologies.json ===

Very much like concepts.json but for "used technologies" instead of "referenced concepts".
