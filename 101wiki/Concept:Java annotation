Language construct for [[metadata]] in [[Language:Java]] [[program]]s

== Illustration ==

In [[Language:Java]] (and many other programming languages likewise), [[metadata]] can be associated with program constructs by means of designated language support. Such metadata goes by the name of annotations in Java. For instance, when a method should be tagged to be a "test method" for [[Technology:JUnit]], then this would look as follows:

<syntaxhighlight lang="java">
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

public class Tests {
    @Test
    public void test42() {
		assertEquals(42.0, 42.0, 0.0);
	}
}
</syntaxhighlight>

Thus, "@Test" is the annotation which tells JUnit to execute the "test42" method along test execution. That is, "@Test" is metadata about the method "test42". JUnit is essentially a [[metaprogram]] that looks for such metadata.
