Rules used for [[type checking]] or [[type inference|inference]]

== Illustration ==

Consider a [[function application]] in [[Language:Haskell]] like this:

<syntaxhighlight lang="haskell">
not True
</syntaxhighlight>

This expression applies logical negation (''not'') to the Boolean literal ''True''. (For what it matters, the result of the function application would be ''False''.) This expression type-checks because the associated rule of the type system succeeds, which is that '''the type of a function application is the result type of the applied function where the actual argument must be of the declared formal argument type'''.
