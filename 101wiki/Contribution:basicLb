== Headline ==

A basic [[Technology:LogicBlox]]-based implementation

== Motivation ==

This implementation is a good starting point for demonstrating [[Technology:LogicBlox]]. The most basic structural and behavioral features are implemented. Other [[Technology:LogicBlox]]-based implementations may start from here. There is an even simpler implementation,  [[Contribution:trivialLb]], from which the present implementation is derived as a straightforward extension. That is, some simplifying restrictions on data modeling are lifted: absence of managers and limitation to a simple company. 

== Architecture ==

This implementation inherits its architecture from [[Contribution:trivialLb]].

== Usage ==

Tested with [[Technology:LogicBlox]] 3.7.

Run "make" for a self-testing illustration.
