== Intent ==

== Description ==

xsd.exe is a tool that generates XML schemas or [[Technology:CLR]] classes from XDR, XML, and XSD files, or from classes in a [[runtime]] assembly. The tool can be used in different reasons; one is for classes for strongly typed DataSet objects; another is plain old C# classes for  [[Object-XML mapping]] (say, XML data binding).

== Local components ==

=== Function:xsdToClasses ===

This is the functionality for generating classes from XSD as used in [[Technology:.NET XML Serialization]].

==== Language:CodeDomFromXsd ====

xsd.exe generates code based on .NET's CodeDom model.
The xsdToClasses functionality generates very specific CodeDom.
Hence, a name is introduced here for that subset.
For instance, the generated code does not use methods.
Also, the generated code only contains classes but no interfaces.

===== Language:CSharpFromXsd =====

Based on CodeDom provider that is used, C# code may be generated by xsd.exe eventually.

=== Function:xsdToDataSets ===

This is another functionality provided by xsd.exe.
It is about generating classes for typed datasets.
