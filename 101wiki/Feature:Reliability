Reliability of the system services

== Description ==

This is a loosely defined [[101execution|execution quality]] of the system to be reliable or fault-tolerant in some way. For instance, suppose that [[Feature:Distribution]] is used for system architecture, then we could require that the system should function even if a server component is terminated such that the server component is automatically restarted.
