Type parameters of a higher [[kind]] than "*"

== Illustration ==

Higher-kinded polymorphism is popular in [[Language:Haskell]] with several well-known [[type class]]es being parameterized in [[type constructor]]s rather than [[type]]s, e.g.:
* Type class ''Monad''; see the concept of [[monad]].
* Type class ''Functor''; see the concept of [[functor]].
