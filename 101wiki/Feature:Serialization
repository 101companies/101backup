[[Serialization]] for company data
== Description ==

Company data must be serializable so that data is preserved also during downtimes of the [[@system]]. Any [[serialization]] format is conceivable here. Serialized data would be typically stored in the file system between program runs.
== Motivation ==

Programming languages differ in terms of [[serialization]] approaches in interesting ways. In addition, multiple reasonable [[serialization]] options may exist for even the same language.
== Illustration ==

One reasonable [[serialization]] format is [[Language:JSON]]. The typical sample company is represented in [[Language:JSON]] as follows:

<syntaxhighlight lang="javascript">
{ 
  "name" : "Acme Corporation",
  "departments" : [
    {
      "name" : "Research",
      "manager" : {
        "name" : "Fred",
        "salary" : 88888
      }   
    },
    {
      "name" : "Development",
      "manager" : {
        "name" : "Marie",
        "salary" : 77777
      },
      "departments" : [
        {
          "name" : "Dev1",
          "manager" : {
            "name" : "Bob",
            "salary" : 77776
          }
        },
        {
          "name" : "Dev2",
          "manager" : {
            "name" : "Alice",
            "salary" : 77775
          },
          "employees" : [
            {
              "name" : "Ralf",
              "salary" : 4711
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
</syntaxhighlight>

Various languages blend well with [[Language:JSON]] as [[serialization]] format. For instance, [[Language:Python]] provides library support to serialize [[Language:Python]]'s [[dictionary|dictionaries]] in [[Language:JSON]]. For instance, in the following code, the ''load'' method of a [[Language:JSON]] [[API]] is used to deserialize on-file [[Language:JSON]] content.

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
company = json.load(open(sys.argv[1], 'r'))
</syntaxhighlight>

== Relationships ==

* See [[Feature:Open serialization]] and [[Feature:Closed serialization]] for concrete serialization features.
* [[Feature:Persistence]] is concerned with [[persistence]] instead of [[serialization]].
== Guidelines ==

* This is an abstract (an XOR) feature, which should not be chosen as such, but instead either [[Feature:Open serialization]] or [[Feature:Closed serialization]] is to be selected.
* A suitable ''demonstration'' of serialization should deserialize company data so that the "resurrected" company can be processed, e.g., by totaling salaries according to [[Feature:Total]]. Also, round-tripping of serialization should be demonstrated such that serialization of given data following by de-serialization returns the same data.
