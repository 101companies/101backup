== Headline ==

[[Language:SQL|SQL]]-based implementation tailored to [[Technology:MySQL|MySQL]]
== Motivation ==

A [[relational schema]] provides the [[data model]] of the [[@system]]. Some [[functional requirement]]s of the system are modeled as [[Language:SQL|SQL]] statements.
== Relationships ==

* See [[Contribution:mySqlMany]] for a slightly more complicated variation which supports many companies instead of a single company.
* Various contributions (see the backlinks) use the present contribution (or its variant [[Contribution:mySqlMany]]) for their database components.
== Usage ==

All steps are supported by SQL scripts. Different database setups are conceivable. In the following, we assume a local database MySQL database server based on [[Technology:XAMPP|XAMPP]]. Different means of executing [[Language:SQL|SQL]] statements are conceivable. In the following, we assume the use of the [[Technology:MySQL Workbench|MySQL Workbench]].

The following steps were tested with XAMPP 1.7.3 and MySQL Workbench 5.2.33 on Mac OSX 10.6.
* Download and install XAMPP and MySQL Workbench. 
* Open the "XAMPP Control Panel" and start "Apache" and "Mysql".
** Thereby, a local MySQL Server is now running:
*** Server Host : "localhost"
*** Port : 3306
*** Username : "root"
*** Password : "" (no password)
* Connect to the database in MySQL Workbench.
* Create schema "test".
* Select schema "test" and make it the default.
* Create tables (run SQL script Company.sql).
* Populate tables (run SQL script sampleCompany.sql).
* Total all salaries (run SQL script Total.sql).
* Cut all salaries (run SQL script Cut.sql).
* Total all salaries, again (run SQL script Total.sql).
