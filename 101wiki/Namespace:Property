The namespace for semantic properties used on this wiki

== Description ==

This wiki uses properties of [[Technology:Semantic MediaWiki]] to provide semantically rich links between pages on this wiki and also links to external web pages. For instance, a contribution page uses "uses" properties to identify pages for languages and technologies that are used by the contribution. To give another example, all kinds of pages may engage in isA/instanceOf relationships for the purpose of classification. This namespace collects all those properties.

=== List of existing properties ===

* [[Property:Uses]]: a contribution declaring language or technology usage.
* [[Property:Implements]]: a contribution declaring feature implementation.
* [[Property:DevelopedBy]]: a contribution declaring a contributor to be a developer.
* [[Property:InstanceOf]]: an "instance-of" (typeOf) relationship.
* [[Property:IsA]]: an "is-a" (subtypeOf) relationship.
* [[Property:PartOf]]: a "part-of" relationship.
* [[Property:Identifies]]: a 101wiki page that corresponds to a web resource (e.g., a Wikipedia page).
* [[Property:LinksTo]]: a 101wiki page that refers to some web resource.
* [[Property:Cites]]: a 101wiki page that cites some web resource.

Note that lower case is used in actual property markup as opposed to upper case in the property page names above.

=== Process for adding a property ===
