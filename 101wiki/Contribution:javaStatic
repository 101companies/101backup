Modular programming with [[static method]]s in [[Language:Java|]]
== Characteristics ==

Operations on companies are implemented as families of [[static method]]s with a class designated to each operation. This is straightforward '''if''' the operations are not polymorphic. This is the case for the given object model which only uses object composition as opposed to class inheritance or interface polymorphism.
== Illustration ==

The data model is implemented with object composition. For example Companies:

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/model/Company.java/class/Company"/>

[[Feature:Closed serialization]] is implemented using [[Language:Java]] [[Technology:Object Streams]]:

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Serialization.java/class/Serialization/method/deserializeCompany"/>

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Serialization.java/class/Serialization/method/serializeCompany"/>

[[Feature:Total]] and [[Feature:Cut]] are implemented as static mathods iterating over departments and employees:

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Total.java/class/Total/method/total"/>

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Cut.java/class/Cut/method/cut"/>

Test cases are implemented for all [[Namespace:Feature]]s.

== Architecture ==

The contribution follows a standardized structure:
* inputs contains input files for tests
* src/main/java contains the following packages:
** org.softlang.company.features for implementations of [[Functional requirements]].
** org.softlang.company.model for implementations of [[Feature:Company]].
* src/test/java contains the following packages:
** org.softlang.company.tests for [[Technology:JUnit]] test cases for [[Namespace:Feature]]s.
== Usage ==

This contribution uses [[Technology:Gradle]] for building. [[Technology:Eclipse]] is supported.
