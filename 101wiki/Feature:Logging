Logging and analysis of salary changes
== Description ==

Salaries of employees may change over time. For instance, a salary cut systematically decreases salaries. Of course, a pay raise could also happen; point-wise salary changes are conceivable as well. Salary changes are to be logged so that they can be analyzed within some window of interest. Specifically, a salary cut is to be logged with names of affected employees, salary before the change, and salary after the change. The log is to be analyzed in a statistical manner to determine the [[median]] and the [[mean]] of all salary deltas.
== Motivation ==

The feature requires [[logging]] of updates to employee salaries. Depending on the programming language at hand, such logging may necessitate revision of the code that changes salaries. Specifically, logging of salary changes according to a salary cut may necessitate adaptation of the actual [[transformation]] for cutting salaries. Logging may turn out as a [[crosscutting concern]], which may be implemented in a scattered manner, unless some strong means of [[modularization]] can be adopted.
== Illustration ==

The log for salary cut for the "standard" sample company would look as follows.

<pre>
[ LogEntry {name = "Craig", oldSalary = 123456.0, newSalary = 61728.0},
  LogEntry {name = "Erik", oldSalary = 12345.0, newSalary = 6172.5},
  LogEntry {name = "Ralf", oldSalary = 1234.0, newSalary = 617.0},
  LogEntry {name = "Ray", oldSalary = 234567.0, newSalary = 117283.5},
  LogEntry {name = "Klaus", oldSalary = 23456.0, newSalary = 11728.0},
  LogEntry {name = "Karl", oldSalary = 2345.0, newSalary = 1172.5},
  LogEntry {name = "Joe", oldSalary = 2344.0, newSalary = 1172.0}
]
</pre>

For what it matters, the salary cut operates as a depth-first, left-to-right traversal of the company; thus the order of the entries in the log. Projection of changes to deltas and sorting them results in the following list of deltas:

<pre>
[ -117283.5,
  -61728.0,
  -11728.0,
  -6172.5,
  -1172.5,
  -1172.0,
  -617.0
]
</pre>

Clearly, the [[median]] is the element in the middle:

<pre>
-6172.5
</pre>

By contrast, the [[mean]] is much different because of the skewed distribution of salaries:

<pre>
-28553.355
</pre>

See [[Contribution:haskellLogging]] for a simple implementation of the feature in [[Language:Haskell]].
== Relationships ==

* The present feature builds on top of [[Feature:Cut]], as it is required to demonstrate the analysis of logged deltas for the transformation of a salary cut.
* The present feature should be applicable to any data model of companies, specifically [[Feature:Flat company]] and [[Feature:Hierarchical company]].
== Guidelines ==

* The ''name'' of the type for logs should involve the term "log".
* A suitable ''demonstration'' of the feature's implementation should cut the sample company and compute the median of the salary deltas, as indeed stipulated above.

* [[isA::Functional requirement]]
* [[isA::Optional feature]]
