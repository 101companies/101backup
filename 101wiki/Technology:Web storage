== Intent ==

A [[Language:JavaScript]] [[API]] for [[Client|client]] side data storage in the [[Language:HTML5]] ecosystem

== Discussion ==

There are four major differences in behaviour between [[cookie]]s and Web storage <cite>W3C2012WS, MSDN2012WS</cite>, which are shown within this implementation: 

* the Web storage offers a largely enhanced amount of data (up to 5MB-10MB for web storage, 4KB for cookies),
* there is no need to use special parameters within the pages' URL to refer to a cookie with the required data,
* the [[Client|client]] does not need to transmit data to the [[Server|server]] with every request,
* and the data within Web storage never expires, if there is no explicit command to do so.
