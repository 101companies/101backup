[[Model to Model transformation]]s with [[ATL plugin]]s

== Motivation ==

[[Model to Model transformation]]s with [[ATL plugin]]s are exercised in this implementation. The main purpose of this implementation is to execute two [[ATL plugin]]s, [[Contribution:atlCutPlugin]] and [[Contribution:atlTotalPlugin]]. 

== Architecture ==

* The transformations are provided by the plugins
* The "Metamodels" folder contains the two [[metamodel]]s used by the plugins
* The  "Models" folder contains the [[model]] that is transformed by the plugins
* RunTransfoPlugins.java contains the code for executing the two transformations

== Usage ==
A Eclipse version with an installed ATL plugin is needed to execute the transformations (e.g. [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-modeling-tools/junor the EMF version] with the installed ATL Framework).
Furthermore, this contributions relies on two other contributions, which are plugins that contain the actual transformations. Those contributions are [[Contribution:atlCutPlugin]] and [[Contribution:atlTotalPlugin]].

Steps:
* Import all three contributions (this one,  [[Contribution:atlCutPlugin]] and [[Contribution:atlTotalPlugin]]) into Eclpise
* This contribution will provide an executable Java file called "RunTransfoPlugins.java"
* Right click on that Java file and select "Run as" -> "Java Application"

Comments:
* The results of the transformations will be in the Models/Plugins folder
* A refresh of the Eclipse Project (Right click, then select "Refresh") might be needed before Eclipse shows the results
