== Headline ==

Processing [[Language:JSON]]-based data in [[Language:Python]]

== Motivation ==

This is a very basic implementation which shows to process company data, externally represented in [[Language:JSON]], can be processed with basic idioms of [[Language:Python]]. The JSON input is represented in memory as a hierarchically nested dictionary. Hence, all processing depends on recursive loops over the dictionary.

== Architecture ==

There are modules for the basic features.

* [[Feature:Total]]: "total.py"
* [[Feature:Cut]]: "cut.py"

The sample company is available as a JSON file "input.json".

== Usage ==

Tested with Python 2.7.3.

There is Makefile that automates a test case; see the "test target".

All steps could as well be executed just on the command line.

<pre>
./total.py input.json
326927
./cut.py input.json output.json
./total.py output.json
163462
</pre>
