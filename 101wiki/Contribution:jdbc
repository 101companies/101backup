Database programming with [[Technology:JDBC|JDBC]]

== Characteristics ==

We use JDBC/SQL for data processing. That is, we use embedded SQL in Java.

== Usage ==

* You need a suitable JDBC Driver for MySQL
** An appropriate driver is available here: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/
** Some version of that driver is readily included into the project.
* Set up a company database.
** Follow the steps described here [[Contribution:mySqlMany]] to set up the company database. That is, stop after populating the tables. 
* There are JUnit tests available as the package ''org.softlang.tests''.
** Run class ''Query'' first to exercise query features.
** Run class ''Transform'' next to modify the database state.
** ''Query'' does not succeed anymore once ''Transform'' was executed.
