The repository of the [[@project]]

== Description ==

[[@repo]] is a confederated or virtual repository in that it actually consists of many physical repositories.
Those contributing repositories may either cover some architectural component of the [[@project]] (such as the [[@worker]]) or individual [[@contribution]]s or collections thereof (such as [[@haskell]] or [[@simplejava]]). Especially those repositories with contributions are collected in a [https://github.com/101companies/101repo/blob/master/.gitdeps registry]. Please send an email to 101companies@gmail.com, if you want entries to be added or modified.
