Basic company structure
== Description ==

There are the following major kinds of entities involved:

* ''Companies''
* ''Employees''
* ''Departments''

''Departments'' are only involved if and only if sub-feature [[Feature:Hierarchical company]] as opposed to sub-feature [[Feature:Flat company]] is chosen.

Entities are composed of parts as follows:

* A ''company'' has a ''name''.
* A ''company'' has ''employees'' maintained in some sort of collection. 
* A ''company'' has (possibly) ''departments''.
* An ''employee'' has a ''name'', a ''salary'' and an ''address''.

There are the following additional assumptions:

* Company names are strings such as "Acme".
* Employee names are strings such as "Joe".
* Addresses are strings such as "Redmond".
* Salaries are non-negative floating point numbers such as "42.42".
* Employee names are unique across companies.

The following simplifications and omissions are deliberate:

* In reality, employee names are not necessarily unique.
* In reality, a company may have a CEO, CFO, etc. omitted here.
* Salaries may call for a money type also including a currency.
== Motivation ==

This feature triggers use of basic data modeling techniques in implementing the [[@system]]. Basic company structure suffices with a tree-like representation of companies.
== Illustration ==

See [[Feature:Flat company]] and [[Feature:Hierarchical company]] for illustration.
== Relationships ==

* See [[Feature:Flat company]] and [[Feature:Hierarchical company]] for concrete  features for this abstract feature for basic company structure.
* There are several other features that also deal with extras of company structure: [[Feature:COI]], [[Feature:Mentoring]], [[Feature:Ranking]], and [[Feature:Singleton]].
== Guidelines ==

This is an abstract (an XOR) feature, which should not be chosen as such, but instead either [[Feature:Flat company]] or [[Feature:Hierarchical company]] is to be selected.
== Metadata ==
