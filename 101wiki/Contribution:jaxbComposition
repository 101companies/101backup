[[Object-XML mapping]] for [[Language:Java]] and [[Language:XSD]] with [[Technology:JAXB]]

== Characteristics ==

[[Language:XML]] import and export is supported for a Java-based implementation by means of O/X mapping. The primary data model for companies is an XML schema. The schema compiler [[Technology:xjc]] of [[Technology:JAXB]] is used to generate Java classes from the schema. In this manner, operations on an XML representation of companies can be implemented in near-to-regular OO fashion while using a problem-specific object model. In different terms, one can carry out [[XML processing]] while essentially staying in the technological space of [[objectware]]. It is insightful to compare XML schema and schema-derived classes. The XML schema is defined in a manner that the resulting object model systematically leverages [[object composition]] and no [[class inheritance]]. In fact, the schema-derived classes are very similar to a regular OO design; see 
[[Contribution:javaComposition]]. It is important to note that the operations on companies are not implemented as [[instance method]]s since this would imply modification of schema-derived classes---unless advanced  modularization mechanisms were leveraged. Instead, the operations are implemented as [[static method]]s in non-schema-derived classes.

== Illustration ==

The data model is implemented as xml files (sampleCompany.xml) that conform to a schema (Company.xsd). For example departments:

<syntaxhighlight lang="xml">
 <xs:element name="department">
  <xs:complexType>
   <xs:sequence>
    <xs:element ref="name"/>
    <xs:element name="manager" type="employee"/>
    <xs:element ref="department" maxOccurs="unbounded" minOccurs="0"/>
    <xs:element name="employee"
        type="employee" maxOccurs="unbounded" minOccurs="0"/>
   </xs:sequence>
  </xs:complexType>
 </xs:element>    
</syntaxhighlight>

Actual [[Language:Java]] classes will be generated using [[Technology:xjc]].

[[Feature:Open serialization]] is implemented using [[Technology:JAXB]] Un-/Marshaller:

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Serialization.java/class/Serialization/method/deserializeCompany"/>

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Serialization.java/class/Serialization/method/serializeCompany"/>

[[Feature:Total]] and [[Feature:Cut]] are implemented as static methods:

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Total.java/class/Total"/>

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Cut.java/class/Cut"/>

Test cases are implemented for all [[Namespace:Feature]]s.

For Object/XML mapping see [[Contribution:jaxbChoice]] (XSD with choice for different subunits), [[Contribution:jaxbComposition]] (XSD with object composition), [[Contribution:jaxbExtension]] (XSD with type extension) and [[Contribution:jaxbSubstitution]] (XSD with substitution groups).

== Architecture ==

The contribution follows a standardized structure:
* inputs contains input files for tests
* src/main/java contains the following packages:
** org.softlang.company.features for implementations of [[Functional requirements]].
* src/test/java contains the following packages:
** org.softlang.company.tests for [[Technology:JUnit]] test cases for [[Namespace:Feature]]s.

== Usage ==

This contribution uses [[Technology:Gradle]] for building. [[Technology:Eclipse]] is supported.
