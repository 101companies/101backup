Exercise [[XML processing]] with [[Language:XPath]] embedded in [[Language:Java]]
== Characteristics ==

Companies are represented in [[Language:XML]] and processed by XPath and Java.  
XPath is embedded into Java code which makes it possible to process
query results in Java. Query results are bound to DOM-like node sets, and
one can iterate over those and mutate them, thereby implementing
impure transformations.
== Illustration ==

The data model is implemented as xml files (sampleCompany.xml).

[[Feature:Open serialization]] is implemented using [[Technology:DOM]] Document objects:

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Serialization.java/class/Serialization/method/loadDocument"/>

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Serialization.java/class/Serialization/method/saveDocument"/>

[[Feature:Total]] and [[Feature:Cut]] are implemented by using [[Technology:DOM]] trees and [[Language:XPath]] queries:

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Total.java/class/Total/method/total"/>

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Cut.java/class/Cut/method/cut"/>

The [[Language:XPath]] processor is implemented by [[Technology:Xalan-Java]].

Test cases are implemented for all [[Namespace:Feature]]s.
== Relationships ==

For DOM-like implementations of in-memory XML processing see [[Contribution:dom]], [[Contribution:jdom]] and [[Contribution:xom]].

For a query-based implementation of in-memory XML processing see [[Contribution:xpathAPI]].

For push-based XML processing see [[Contribution:sax]].

For Object/XML mapping see [[Contribution:jaxbChoice]] (XSD with choice for different subunits), [[Contribution:jaxbComposition]] (XSD with object composition), [[Contribution:jaxbExtension]] (XSD with type extension) and [[Contribution:jaxbSubstitution]] (XSD with substitution groups).
== Architecture ==

The contribution follows a standardized structure:
* inputs contains input files for tests
* src/main/java contains the following packages:
** org.softlang.company.features for implementations of [[Functional requirements]].
* src/test/java contains the following packages:
** org.softlang.company.tests for [[Technology:JUnit]] test cases for [[Namespace:Feature]]s.
== Usage ==

This contribution uses [[Technology:Gradle]] for building. [[Technology:Eclipse]] is supported.
