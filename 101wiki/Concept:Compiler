A program that transforms source code into object code
== Illustration ==

Let's assume that we want to compile the [[Language:Java]] variation on the [[Hello world program]].

That is, the source code of the program is available as a file "HelloWorld.java".

Compilation can be issued in different ways. For instance, an [[IDE]] may take care of it automatically.

For clarity, we perform compilation at the command line:

<pre>
$ ls
HelloWorld.java
$ javac HelloWorld.java 
$ ls
HelloWorld.class	HelloWorld.java
</pre>

Thus, the compiler produced the object code, in fact, [[Language:Java bytecode|bytecode]], in the file "HelloWorld.class".

The byte code can be executed as follows:

<pre>
$ java HelloWorld
Hello, world!
</pre>

The byte code appears to be interpreted, i.e., "java" appears to be an [[interpreter]] for byte code. In fact, "java" performs [[just-in-time compilation]] so that byte code is translated on the fly to machine code, which is then eventually executed (so to say interpreted) by the actual machine.
