On the one hand, there is no widely accepted definition of the term "toolkit". In fact, the term toolkit is also used in the sense of a GUI toolkit, where it refers to a set of widgets (e.g., OO classes) to implement GUIs.
On the other hand, there does not seem to be any established term that captures the above-mentioned intent. 
Hence, the term "toolkit" is pragmatically claimed by this ontology.
