== Headline ==

a simple [[Language:Prolog]]-based implementation

== Motivation ==

We demonstrate the most basic style of logic programming for modeling company structure and basic operations.

== Architecture ==

There is a predicate total/2 to total all salaries in a company.
There is a predicate cut/2 to cut all salaries in half.
There is a predicate depth/2 to compute the nesting depth of departments.

== Usage ==

See the Makefile for running the tests.

The code has been tested with SWI-Prolog 5.10.1.
