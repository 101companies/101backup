== Intent ==

the [[capability]] of mapping [[grammarware]] to [[objectware]]

== Description ==

Text-to-object mapping entails conversion of text-based (or otherwise grammar-ruled) structure to object-based structure. The assumption is here that a grammar and an object model are involved here which are meant to correspond to each other in some manner made explicit by the mapping.
