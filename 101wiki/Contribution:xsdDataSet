== Intent ==

X/O/R mapping with [[Technology:xsd.exe]] and strongly typed DataSets

== Motivation ==

X/O mapping within the .NET platform is exercised. This is a variation on [[Contribution:xsdClasses]]; we generate typed DataSets as opposed to classes for plain objects.

== Architecture ==

See [[Contribution:xsdClasses]].

== Usage ==

[[Technology:Visual Studio]] 2010 should be used to open a project file. The project itself is a class-library and compiles into a DLL. To run a project you must execute at least one unit test (or all at once).
Nunit GUI or other Visual studio extension (e.g. Resharper) should be used for executing unit tests.

The following command should be used if one wants to re-generate C# sources from xsd file: xsd Company.xsd /dataset /out:../

The contribution has been tested with C# Version 4.0, the .NET Framework Version 4.0 and NUnit Version 2.5.
