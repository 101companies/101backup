[[Model to Model transformation]]s with an [[ATL plugin]]

== Motivation ==
[[Model to Model transformation]]s with an [[ATL plugin]] is exercised in this implementation. Since a [[ATL plugin]] is usually a single [[transformation]], the only feature that is implemented by this contribution is the Total feature, which is an [[exogenous model transformation]].

== Illustration ==

This contribution is mostly autogenerated by [[Language:ATL]] and [[Technology:Eclipse]]. The only manual component is the actual transformation, which is a standard [[Language:ATL]] [[transformation]] which can also be found in [[Contribution:atl]]. The [[metamodel]] that is used by the transformation must be provided by the implementation that uses the plugin.

== Architecture ==

* The transformation can be found in the "ATL_TotalPlugin/files" subfolder

== Usage ==

This implementation is not meant to be executed alone. It is used by [[Contribution:atlPluginUsage]]
