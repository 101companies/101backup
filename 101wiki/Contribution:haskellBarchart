Analysis of historical company data with [[Language:Haskell]]
== Characteristics ==

Historical data is simply represented as list of year-value pairs so that company data is snapshotted for a number of years and any analysis of historical data can simply map over the versions. A simple chart package for Haskell is leveraged to visualize the development of salary total and median over the years. In this manner, the contribution demonstrates how to declare external dependences via [[Technology:Cabal]]. Further, the contribution also demonstrates [[modularization]] and code organization. In particular, where clauses for [[local scope]] and export/import clauses for [[modularization]] are used carefully.
== Illustration ==

We would like to generate barcharts as follows:

[[media:https://raw.github.com/101companies/101haskell/master/contributions/haskellBarchart/baselines/total.svg]]

[[media:https://raw.github.com/101companies/101haskell/master/contributions/haskellBarchart/baselines/median.svg]]

These barcharts are generated by the following functionality. Given a filename, a title (such as "Total" or "Median") and a year-to-data mapping, generate a PNG file with the barchart for the distribution of the data.

<fragment url="src/Company/History.hs/function/chart"/>

The median is computed as follows:

<fragment url="src/Company/Median.hs/pattern/median "/>
