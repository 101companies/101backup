== Headline ==

A [[Language:Clojure|Clojure]]-based implementation that uses [[Refs|transactional references]]

== Motivation == 

[[Language:Clojure|Clojure]] provides a number of interesting approaches to 
the development with [[concurrency]]. One of these approaches is the use of 
programmable [[transactions]], analogous to [[database]] [[transactions]]. 
This functionality is implemented by means of transaction-specific functions 
and references. To maintain a consistent memory state, 
[[Language:Clojure|Clojure]] relies on a [[Technology:STM|STM]]. This project 
is based on the implementation [[Contribution:clojure]] and changes it 
so that [[Refs]] and [[transactions]] are used.

== Illustration ==

Changes to [[Refs]] by a transformation like [[Feature:Cut]] have to be
encapsulated into a [[transaction]]. In [[Language:Clojure|Clojure]] the 
function ''dosync'' starts such a transaction allowing to alter [[Refs]] by 
an update function. 

 <nowiki>
(defn cutCompany [c]
    (dosync
        ;; alter ref function
        (alter c #(update-in % [:depts] (partial map cutDept))))
    ;; returning changed ref
    c)
</nowiki>

== Architecture ==

* ''company.clj'' definitions of the companies structure using clojure's defrecord
* ''scenarios.clj'' functionalities: [[Feature:Cut]], [[Feature:Total]]
* ''meganalysis.clj'' a sample company (i.e. a [[Refs|Ref]] to a [[Feature:Hierarchical_company]])

== Usage ==

You need to install the [[Technology:Eclipse|Eclipse]] plugin [[Technology:CounterClockwise|CounterClockwise]]. 
Update Site: [http://ccw.cgrand.net/updatesite]

Then open ''meganalysis.clj'', hit "run" and excute the function you like:
* ''(totalCompany meganalysis)'' 
* ''(cutCompany meganalysis)''

The implementation has been tested with Eclipse version 3.7 and [[Technology:CounterClockwise]]  Eclipse plugin (Version 0.3.0).
