Systematic exploration of a [[tree]]- or [[graph]]-like [[data structure]] in programming

== Illustration ==

Consider the problem of totaling the salaries of all employees in a company (e.g., according to [[Feature:Total]]). Assume that the company is represented as a tree- or graph-like structure (e.g., in the sense of terms of [[algebraic data type]]s, [[Language:XML]] trees, or [[object]] graphs). Thus, the aggregation of all the salaries boils down to a traversal of the tree (or the graph).
