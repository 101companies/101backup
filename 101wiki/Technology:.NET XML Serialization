== Intent == 

.NET's approach to [[Object-XML mapping]]

== Components ==

* [[dotnet:System.Xml.Serialization]]
* [[Technology:xsd.exe]]

== Description ==

This technology supports [[open serialization]] with [[Language:XML]] for .NET. It relies on the .NET namespace [[dotnet:System.Xml.Serialization]] and the class generator tool [[Technology:xsd.exe]]. Plain-old .NET classes can be annotated so that their serialization properties are defined in terms of element names, fields or properties to be included, and others. Such classes can also be generated with the [[Technology:xsd.exe]] tool from an [[Language:XSD|XML schema]].
