== Headline ==

A [[Technology:LogicBlox]]-based implementation that makes good use of [[Language:DatalogLB]] modules

== Motivation ==

This is a fully modularized variation on [[Contribution:basicLb]]. There are modules for the schema, the instance, the query for totaling salaries, the transformation for cutting salaries. The modules for query and transformation use inactive blocks. [[Technology:LogicBlox]] also enables modularity and separate compilation for basic [[Language:DatalogLB]] files; see [[Contribution:projectLb]] for an illustration. The present implementation uses proper module syntax though; each module declares explicitly the module and visibility of declarations and rules.

== Architecture ==

The implementation consists of these modules:
* ''oneOone/Schema.logic'': the schema for companies
* ''oneOone/Instance.logic'': the Acme company (and another company for testing)
* ''oneOone/total.logic'': the query for totaling salaries
* ''oneOone/cut.logic'': the delta for cutting salaries

There are these additional files:
* ''modularLb.project'': LogicBlox project description
* ''Makefile'': script for running the implementation
* ''baseline'': baseline for regression testing

== Usage ==

Tested with [[Technology:LogicBlox]] 3.7.

This implementation requires that lb-services is running.

Run "make" for a self-testing illustration.
