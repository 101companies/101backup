== Intent ==

This contribution is supposed to demonstrate YAPAF(1) capabilities on the basis of [Contribution:php] by implementing logging.

(1) https://github.com/SchulteMarkus/YAPAF

== Motivation ==

YAPAF "Yet another PHP aspect framework" brings aspect-capabilities to [Language:PHP], similar to [Language:AspectJ]. This contribution uses YAPAF to implement some logging-feature to [Contribution:php] realized via a YAPAF-aspect. The contribution is showing a possible use-case for using YAPAF.

== Details ==

You can find the contribution at https://github.com/SchulteMarkus/101repo-php-yapaf/tree/master/contributions/php-yapaf

The aspects are defined at dir "aspects". As code is evolving, please have a look at the repository to see an YAPAF-aspect in action.

An an abstract, a YAPAF-aspect is a simple php-class including one or more methods. Using annotaions, each method defines it's possible JoinPoints:

<syntaxhighlight lang="php">
class LoggingAspect {

    /**
     * @Call(class="ClassToLog", method="methodToLog")
     */
    public function log() {
        # apsect-body
    }
}
</syntaxhighlight>
