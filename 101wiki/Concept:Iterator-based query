== Headline ==

A particularly simple and regular kind of [[query]]

== Description ==

Queries may be arbitrarily complicated in how they extract data from given data. An [[iterator-based query]] is relatively simple and regular in so far that it may be understood as performing data extraction, conceptually, through iteration over some well-defined set of components of interest within compound input data. For instance, components of interest may be characterized by their type.

== Illustration ==

[[Feature:Total]] is concerned with an [[iterator-based query]] which extracts data (salaries) from all employees of a company.
