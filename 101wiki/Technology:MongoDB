MongoDB is an open-source [[Technology:Document-oriented database]].

== Description ==

MongoDB is a database which holds documents in the JSON-like [[Language:BSON]] format.
A single database may consist of several collections in which documents are organized.

To query a database collection, [[Language:BSON]] objects are passed which are matched against collection entries. Certain object keys may also have a special use as operators. A typical query may look like this:

<syntaxhighlight lang="javascript">
> db.employees.find({"salary" : {"$lt" : 2000}});
</syntaxhighlight>

MongoDB also realizes [[Technology:Data Aggregation]] using an internal MapReduce implementation based on [[Language:JavaScript]]. This works on collection level by passing JavaScript functions for map and reduce steps to the database.

A simple example of aggregating statistical data may be the counting of tags attributed to a blog post or product in a database collection. If the collection contains documents of the form

<syntaxhighlight lang="javascript">
{..., tags: ["foo", "bar", ...], ...}
</syntaxhighlight>

A map function that emits a count for each tag might look like this:

<syntaxhighlight lang="javascript">
> var mapfun = function() {
  this.tags.forEach(function(tag) {
    this.emit(tag, {"count" : 1});
  });
}
</syntaxhighlight>

And a corresponding reduce function that emits the summed up tags will look like this:

<syntaxhighlight lang="javascript">
> var reducefun = function(key, values) {
  var total = 0;
  values.forEach(function(value) {
    total += value.count;
  });
  return total;
} 
</syntaxhighlight>

To run everything a MapReduce query is formulated:

<syntaxhighlight lang="javascript">
> db.blogposts.mapReduce(mapfun, reducefun {"out" : "output"});
</syntaxhighlight>

This will return an object containing data about the processed request and save all results to the new collection "output".
