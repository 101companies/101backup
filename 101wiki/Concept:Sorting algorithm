An [[algorithm]] to solve the [[sorting problem]]

== Citation ==

(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm, 14 April 2012)

A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list in a certain order. The most-used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order. [...] More formally, the output must satisfy two conditions:
# The output is in nondecreasing order (each element is no smaller than the previous element according to the desired total order);
# The output is a permutation (reordering) of the input.
