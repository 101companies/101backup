== Intent ==

demonstrate template metaprogramming with C++

== Motivation ==

This is an esoteric implementation in C++ using template metaprogramming. It isn't how you would ''want'' to ever do this, but there are some pretty simple examples of C++ MPL, so it might be a good example for people wanting to learn C++ MPL.
