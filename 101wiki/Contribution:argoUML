== Headline ==

Structural modeling in UML with [[Technology:ArgoUML]]

== Motivation ==

The class diagrams of this contribution can serve as a specification of the [[Feature:Hierarchical_company]]. Different models are exercised to favor either composition or generalization. In addition, methods for the features [[Feature:Total]] and [[Feature:Cut]] are indicated.

== Architecture ==

The contribution contains .zargos files with the actual models.

The class diagrams are also persisted as .pdf files.

== Usage ==

Open the .zargo files with ArgoUML, if necessary.
