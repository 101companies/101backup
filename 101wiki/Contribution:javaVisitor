== Headline ==

modular programming with [[Visitor pattern|visitors]] in [[Language:Java]]
== Characteristics ==

The present  implementation can be viewed as a variation on [[Contribution:javaInheritance]]. 
The [[Visitor pattern]] is applied to implement operations modularly. 
To this end, two visitor interfaces are defined: one for ''void'' visitors (that
do not return any values), another one for ''returning'' visitors (with a designated
type parameter for the result type). Indeed, [[Feature:Total]] calls
for a returning visitor whereas [[Feature:Cut]] can be expressed as
a void visitor - if an [[impure computation]] is assumed.
== Illustration ==

The data model is implemented with [[class inheritance]]. For example Departments:

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/model/Department.java/class/Department"/>

[[Feature:Closed serialization]] is implemented using [[Language:Java]] [[Technology:Object Streams]]:

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Serialization.java/class/Serialization/method/deserializeCompany"/>

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Serialization.java/class/Serialization/method/serializeCompany"/>

[[Feature:Total]] is implemented as a returning visitor:

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Total.java/class/Total"/>

[[Feature:Cut]] is implemented as a void visitor:

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Cut.java/class/Cut"/>

Test cases are implemented for all [[Namespace:Feature]]s.

== Architecture ==

The contribution follows a standardized structure:
* inputs contains input files for tests
* src/main/java contains the following packages:
** org.softlang.company.features for implementations of [[Functional requirements]].
** org.softlang.company.features.visitor for visitor patterns.
** org.softlang.company.model for implementations of [[Feature:Company]].
* src/test/java contains the following packages:
** org.softlang.company.tests for [[Technology:JUnit]] test cases for [[Namespace:Feature]]s.
== Usage ==

This contribution uses [[Technology:Gradle]] for building. [[Technology:Eclipse]] is supported.
