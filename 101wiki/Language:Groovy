a dynamically typed [[OO programming language]] on the [[Language:Java]] Virtual Machine

== Details ==

Groovy is a dynamically typed language running on the JVM. It tries to be a superset of Java and therefore, most (but not all) Java code is also valid Groovy code.
It also provides first-class functions and can therefore be treated as a [[functional programming language]].
