Lecture "Parsing and unparsing in Haskell" as part of [[Course:Lambdas in Koblenz]]
== Summary ==

[[Grammar]] knowledge is implemented in [[Language:Haskell|Haskell]] for the sake of [[parsing]] and [[unparsing]] [[concrete syntax]]. In both cases, we leverage libraries that provide [[abstraction]]s for composing [[parser]]s or [[unparser]]s, respectively. In the case of parsing, we use the [[Technology:Parsec|Parsec]]  library for parser combinators, which leverages the [[monad]] concept. In the case of unparsing, we leverage the [[Technology:HughesPJ|HughesPJ]] library. (Another term for unparsing is [[pretty printing]].)
