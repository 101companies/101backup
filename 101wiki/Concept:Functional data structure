The specifically functional approach to the implementation of [[data structure]]s

== Illustration ==

See [[immutable list]]s as a simple example of a [[functional data structure]]. See [[Resource:Purely functional data structures]] for a seminal resource (in fact, a PhD thesis) on the subject. See [[Resource:Handbook of data structures and applications]] for a textbook with coverage of the subject.
