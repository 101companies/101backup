The replacement of the occurrence of an abstraction's definition by a reference

== Details ==

For instance, consider the following logic program:

<pre>
a(X) :- b(X), c(X), d(X).
e(X) :- b(X), c(X).
</pre>

The first clause admits folding as follows:

<pre>
a(X) :- e(X), d(X).
</pre>

That is, the body of e/1 occurred in the body of a/1 and hence that occurrence can be replaced by a suitably substituted head of e/1.

The inverse transformation is the [[unfold transformation]].
