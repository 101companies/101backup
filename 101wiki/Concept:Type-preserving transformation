A transformation with the type of the input and output being the same

== Details ==

In the context of [[model-driven engineering]], type-preserving transformations also go by the name of [[endogenous model transformation]]s.

== Illustration ==

Diverse examples of type-preserving transformations:
* A program transformation for optimization.
* An XML transformation that only affects primitive values of selected elements.
* A traversal over an object graph (by a visitor or otherwise) that mutates objects.
* A model transformation where the metamodels of the input and output models are the same.

In the context of the 101companies System, [[Feature:Cut]] corresponds to a type-preserving transformation.
