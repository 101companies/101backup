A reference to a function with a referencing environment
== Citation ==

(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_science), 4 June 2013)

In computer science, a closure (also lexical closure or function closure) is a function or reference to a function together with a referencing environmentâ€”a table storing a reference to each of the non-local variables (also called free variables) of that function. [...]

The concept of closures was developed in the 1960s and was first fully implemented in 1975 [...] as a language feature in the Scheme programming language to support lexically scoped first-class functions.
