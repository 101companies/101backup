An [[algorithm]] to solve the [[search problem]]

== Illustration ==

Consider the following list of ints as the input for sorting:

<syntaxhighlight language=haskell>
[2,4,3,1,4]
</syntaxhighlight>

A search algorithm returns ''True'' if asked to search for 1 and ''False'' for 5.

See [[linear search]] and [[binary search]] for specific search algorithms.

(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm, 14 April 2012)

In computer science, a search algorithm is an algorithm for finding an item with specified properties among a collection of items. The items may be stored individually as records in a database; or may be elements of a search space defined by a mathematical formula or procedure, such as the roots of an equation with integer variables; or a combination of the two, such as the Hamiltonian circuits of a graph.
