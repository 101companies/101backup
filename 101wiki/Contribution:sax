== Headline ==

[[Push-based XML parsing]] in [[Language:Java]] with [[Technology:SAX]]

== Characteristics ==

[[XML processing]]

== Illustration ==

The data model is implemented as xml files (sampleCompany.xml) that conform to a schema (Company.xsd).

[[Feature:Parsing]] is implemented by loading a [[Technology:sax]] XMLreader:

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Parsing.java/class/Parsing/method/parse"/>

[[Feature:Unparsing]] can be implemented by a handler (see Cut).

[[Feature:Total]] is implemented by a SAX handler that totals during a parse:

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Total.java/class/Total/method/getTotal"/>

[[Feature:Cut]] is implemented by a SAX handler that outputs an XML-file with XMLStreamWriter.

The schema is not needed for the basic operations, but one can perform XML validation with regard to the schema (see package org.softlang.company.features.sax)

Test cases are implemented for all [[Namespace:Feature]]s.

== Relationships ==

For DOM-like implementations of in-memory XML processing see [[Contribution:dom]], [[Contribution:jdom]] and [[Contribution:xom]].

For a query-based implementation of in-memory XML processing see [[Contribution:xpathAPI]].

For push-based XML processing see [[Contribution:sax]].

For Object/XML mapping see [[Contribution:jaxbChoice]] (XSD with choice for different subunits), [[Contribution:jaxbComposition]] (XSD with object composition), [[Contribution:jaxbExtension]] (XSD with type extension) and [[Contribution:jaxbSubstitution]] (XSD with substitution groups).

== Architecture ==

The contribution follows a standardized structure:
* inputs contains input files for tests
* src/main/java contains the following packages:
** org.softlang.company.features for implementations of [[Functional requirements]].
*** org.softlang.company.features.sax for additional [[Technology:sax]] functionality.
* src/test/java contains the following packages:
** org.softlang.company.tests for [[Technology:JUnit]] test cases for [[Namespace:Feature]]s.

== Usage ==

This contribution uses [[Technology:Gradle]] for building. [[Technology:Eclipse]] is supported.
