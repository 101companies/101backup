Lecture "First steps in Haskell" as part of [[Course:Lambdas in Koblenz]]
== Summary ==

Functional programming in [[Language:Haskell]] is introduced in this lecture. First, basic concepts of programming (such as [[program]] and [[algorithm]]) are briefly rehashed. Then, key concepts of functional programming (such as [[function]], [[recursion]], [[list]], and [[pattern matching]]) are introduced. Some basic examples are used for illustrations (such as the factorial function and [[linear search]]). Eventually, a major running example of this course is introduced, the so-called [[@system]], which is essentially a trivial information system for human resource management.
