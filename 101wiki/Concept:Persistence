== Intent ==

the [[capability]] of maintaining program data beyond the runtime of the program

== Description ==

The (sometimes implicit) assumption is here that data is not simply maintained but there is 
also support for reading and writing program data incrementally including potentially 
transaction management and efficient index-based access. Without such additional 
requirements, persistence may be hard to distinguish from [[serialization]].
In practice, the capability of persistence is often associated with database technology, 
but there exist also some technologies in other technical spaces that facilitate proper 
persistence. The term persistence is even in use in ways to include the capability of 
[[O/R mapping]] which clearly goes beyond the basic idea of maintaining program data
beyond the runtime of the program; see, for example, [[Technology:Hibernate]] for the
Java platform.
