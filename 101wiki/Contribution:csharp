== Headline ==

A simple implementation in [[Language:CSharp|C#]] for the [[Technology:.NET]] Framework

== Motivation == 

Basic style of [[OO programming]] is exercised. The C# type system is used to create an in-memory representation, in fact, an [[object model]]  for companies, departments, and employees. There is also an
extra base class for persons from which employees are derived, thereby illustrating [[class inheritance]]. Operations on companies are implemented as .  XML-based serialization is immediately available for all public [[Technology:.NET]] classes.

== Architecture ==

C# object-oriented representation of 101companies model is located in
the ''CompanyModel folder''. It contains classes with required
properties and methods (features implementations).

''Tests'' folder contains:
* ''FeaturesTest'' class which covers test cases for the features: [[:Feature:Total]], [[:Feature:Cut]], [[:Feature:Depth]].
* ''SerializationTests'' class which covers test cases for de-/serialization.

Also, helpers for serialization and building the in-memory model for the meganalysis company are implemented.

== Usage ==

[[Technology:Visual Studio]] 2010 should be used to open a project
file. The project itself is a class-library and compiles into a
DLL. To run a project you must execute at least one unit test (or all
at once). The Nunit GUI could be used for executing the unit tests
conveniently.

The project has been tested with:
* C# Programming language used for all code (Version 4.0)
* .NET framework used to execute compiled code (Version 4.0)
* NUnit testing framework used for testing (Version 2.5)
* Visual Studio optional IDE (Version 2010)
