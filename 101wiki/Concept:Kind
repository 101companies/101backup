The type of a type constructor

== Illustration ==

When describing kinds, types are commonly referred to as "*", unary type constructors are referred to as "* -> *", etc. Let us draw illustrations from [[Language:Haskell]]:

* ''()'' (i.e., the empty tuple type) is of kind "*".
* ''[]'' (i.e., the list type constructor) is of kind "* -> *".
* ''Either'' (i.e., the sum type constructor) is of kind "* -> * -> *".
