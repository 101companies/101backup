Data processing in [[Language:Java]] with [[Technology:java.lang.reflect]]
== Characteristics ==

[[Language:Java]]'s [[reflection]] is put to work to walk object graphs in a generic manner so that queries and transformations can be expressed very concisely. The sub-objects in an object graph are made available through a reusable [[iterator]]. Simple queries and transformations (such as [[Feature:Total]] and [[Feature:Cut]]) can be simply implemented by accessing the list of subobjects. The resulting code is thus rather concise, when compared to a conservative implementation, e.g., in [[Contribution:javaComposition]] (and many others). The particular approach implies the use of type casts and thus is limited in terms of static type checking.
