[[Data composition]] in [[Language:Haskell]] with [[algebraic data type]]s

== Characteristics ==

The [[data model]] leverages [[data composition]] for companies with departmental nesting. Thus, an [[algebraic data type]] is used for departments so that recursive nesting can be expressed. The algebraic data type only needs a single [[data constructor]]. Thus, [[data variation]] is not exercised, but see [[Contribution:haskellVariation]] for an alternative with data variation.

== Illustration ==

The data model leverages an [[algebraic data type]] for departments; in this manner recursion is enabled:

<fragment url="src/Company/Data.hs"/>    

A sample company looks like this:

<fragment url="src/Company/Sample.hs"/>    

[[Feature:Total]] is implemented as follows:

<fragment url="src/Company/Total.hs"/>    

The following salary total is computed for the sample company:

<syntaxhighlight lang="haskell">
399747.0
</syntaxhighlight>

== Relationships ==

* See [[Contribution:haskellVariation]] for a contribution with a similar data model such that [[data variation]] is exercised in addition to [[data composition]].
* See [[Contribution:haskellEngineer]] for a contribution with a simple data model without support for departmental nesting. No algebraic data types are leveraged.
* See [[Contribution:haskellData]] for a contribution with a simple data model without support for departmental nesting. Algebraic data types are leveraged systematically for all types to distinguish the types nominally.

== Architecture ==

There are these modules:

* <file url="src/Company/Data.hs"/>: a data model for [[Feature:Hierarchical_company]]
* <file url="src/Company/Sample.hs"/>: a sample company
* <file url="src/Company/Total.hs"/>: the implementation of [[Feature:Total]]
* <file url="src/Company/Cut.hs"/>: the implementation of [[Feature:Cut]]
* <file url="src/Main.hs"/>: Tests

The types of <file url="src/Company/Data.hs"/> implement [[Feature:Closed serialization]] through Haskell's read/show.

== Usage ==
