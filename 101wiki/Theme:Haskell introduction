An introductory collection of [[Language:Haskell]]-based contributions
== Description ==

This theme collects the following relatively basic Haskell-based contributions:

* [[Contribution:haskellStarter|]]: Basics of functional programming
* [[Contribution:haskellEngineer|]]: Basics of software engineering
* [[Contribution:haskellList|]]: List processing with [[Map function|map]] and friends
* [[Contribution:haskellProfessional|]]: Idiomatic code for many features
* [[Contribution:haskellLambda|]]: [[Anonymous function]]s
* [[Contribution:haskellComposition|]]: Recursive [[algebraic data type]]s
* [[Contribution:haskellVariation|]]: Multiple [[constructor]]s per type
* [[Contribution:haskellMonoid|]]: Queries in [[Monoid|monoidal style]]
* [[Contribution:haskellLogging|]]: Logging in non-[[Monad|monadic]] style
* [[Contribution:haskellWriter|]]: Logging in [[Monad|monadic style]]
* [[Contribution:haskellParsec|]]: Parsing with the [[Technology:Parsec|]] library
* [[Contribution:haskellSyb|]]: Generic programming Ã  la [[SYB]] style
== Relationships ==

There are further themes with Haskell-based contributions:
* [[Theme:Haskell potpourri]]: more advanced and diverse coverage of the Haskell ecosystem.
* [[Theme:Haskell data]]: mostly simply variations on data modeling in Haskell.
* [[Theme:Haskell genericity]]: different styles of generic functional programming in Haskell.
