Modeling queries in [[Language:Haskell]] with the help of [[monoid]]s
== Characteristics ==

Several functional requirements are implemented while making explicit use the [[monoid]]s. For instance, [[Feature:Total]] is implemented with the help of the [[sum monoid]]. Only those functional requirements are implemented that indeed may benefit from monoids as such. For instance, [[Feature:Cut]] is not implemented.
== Illustration ==

Consider the implementation of [[Feature:Total]]:

<fragment url="src/Company/Total.hs/function/total"/>

That is, lists of departments and employees are processed by the [[map function]] resulting in lists of intermediate results in the monoid's ''Sum'' type to be reduced accordingly by the monoid's ''mconcat'' operation, which, in turn, is uniformly defined by applying the [[fold function]] to the monoid's binary operation and its identity.
== Relationships ==

* The data model of [[Contribution:haskellComposition]] is reused.
* See [[Contribution:haskellProfessional]] for an implementation of all relevant features without the use of monoids.
== Architecture ==

There are these modules:

* <file url="src/Company/Data.hs"/>: a data model for [[Feature:Hierarchical_company]]
* <file url="src/Company/Sample.hs"/>: a sample company
* <file url="src/Company/Total.hs"/>: the implementation of [[Feature:Total]]
* <file url="src/Company/Depth.hs"/>: the implementation of [[Feature:Depth]]
* <file url="src/Company/Ranking.hs"/>: the implementation of [[Feature:Ranking]]
* <file url="src/Data/Max.hs"/>: a monoid for optional maxima
* <file url="src/Main.hs"/>: Tests

The types of <file url="src/Company/Data.hs"/> implement [[Feature:Closed serialization]] through Haskell's read/show.
