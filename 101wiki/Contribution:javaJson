== Headline ==

Process [[Language:JSON|]] data with [[Language:Java|]]'s [[Technology:javax.json|]] [[API]]

== Characteristics ==

See [[Contribution:dom]] and [[Contribution:jdom]] for a general motivation for exercising
[[in-memory XML processing]]. The present contribution simply commits to [[Language:JSON|]] instead of [[Language:XML|]].

== Relationships ==

[[Contribution:javaJsonHttp]] uses HTTP-based access to the input data instead of going through the file system.

== Usage ==

This contribution uses [[Technology:Gradle]] for building. [[Technology:Eclipse]] is supported.
