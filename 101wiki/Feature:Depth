Compute the nesting depth of departments

== Description ==

The nesting depth of departments within a company is to be computed; see below for details. Let's assume that the management of the company is interested in the nesting depth as a simple indicator for the complexity of the company (or particular departments thereof) in the sense of a hierarchical organization. Nesting depth, together possibly with other metrics and information, could feed into the discussion of reorganizing business structures.

The nesting depth is computed as follows:
* The depth of a department is 1 + the maximum of the depths of its sub-departments.
* In particular, the depth of a department without sub-departments is 1.
* The depth of a company is the maximum of the depths of its (immediate) departments.

== Motivation ==

The feature may be implemented as a [[query]], potentially making use of a suitable [[query language]]. Conceptually, the required query is non-trivial in that it needs to process company structure recursively so that nesting of departments can be properly observed. For instance, it is not straightforward to design a [[Language:SQL]] query that computes indeed nesting depth on a normalized relational schema for company data. Thus, it shall be interesting to see how different software languages, technologies, and implementations succeed in realizing the feature.

== Illustration ==

The feature is illustrated with a [[Function]] in [[Language:Haskell]] that works on top of appropriate [[algebraic data type]]s for company data; the function recurses into company data in a straightforward manner and it counts departments along the way:

<syntaxhighlight lang="haskell">
depth :: Company -> Int
depth (Company   ds) = max' (map depth' ds)
  where
    max' = foldr max 0
    depth' :: Department -> Int
    depth' (Department     ds  ) = 1 + max' (map depth' ds)
</syntaxhighlight>

The snippet originates from [[Contribution:haskellComposition]].

== Relationships ==

* See [[Feature:Total]] for a simpler query scenario. 
* Indeed, the present feature should be tackled only after [[Feature:Total]]. 
* The present feature can only usefully instantiated on top of [[Feature:Hierarchical_company]], as it assumes nesting of departments for non-trivial results.

== Guidelines ==

* The ''name'' of an operation for computing the nesting depth of departments should involve the term "depth".
* A suitable ''demonstration'' of the feature's implementation should compute the depth of a sample company.
* See [[Feature:Total]] for more detailed guidelines on a query scenario, which apply similarly to the present feature.
