a fragment locator for C#

== Description ==

CSharpFragmentLocator  is a part of the [[101companies:Explorer]]; it is a C#-specific tool for fragment location. That is, the technology supports the syntax-aware location of a fragment in C# compilation unit. The input/output behavior of CSharpFragmentLocator is the following:

* Input:
** a C# source code file
** a fragment description
* Output:
** the line range of the located fragment

For fragment description and output format, please refer to [[Technology:JFragmentLocator]].

The C# specific properties can be be selected by using the property name as the method name. Consider this property:

<pre>
public Guid Id { get; set; }
</pre>

It can be selected by using the name "Id" as the method:
<pre>
{
  "method" : "Id"
}
</pre>
