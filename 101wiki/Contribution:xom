== Headline ==

Exercise [[in-memory XML processing]] with [[Technology:XOM]] in [[Language:Java]]

== Characteristics ==

See [[Contribution:dom]] for a general motivation for exercising
[[in-memory XML processing]]. The present implementation simply exercises
yet another DOM-like API. We end up providing a descendants axis to this
end.

== Illustration ==

The data model is implemented as xml files (sampleCompany.xml) that conform to a schema (Company.xsd).

[[Feature:Open serialization]] is implemented using [[Technology:xom]] Builder:

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Serialization.java/class/Serialization/method/deserializeCompany"/>

[[Feature:Total]] and [[Feature:Cut]] are implemented by using descendants:

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Total.java/class/Total/method/total"/>

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Cut.java/class/Cut/method/cut"/>

Test cases are implemented for all [[Namespace:Feature]]s.

== Relationships ==

For DOM-like implementations of in-memory XML processing see [[Contribution:dom]], [[Contribution:jdom]] and [[Contribution:xom]].

For a query-based implementation of in-memory XML processing see [[Contribution:xpathAPI]].

For push-based XML processing see [[Contribution:sax]].

For Object/XML mapping see [[Contribution:jaxbChoice]] (XSD with choice for different subunits), [[Contribution:jaxbComposition]] (XSD with object composition), [[Contribution:jaxbExtension]] (XSD with type extension) and [[Contribution:jaxbSubstitution]] (XSD with substitution groups).

== Architecture ==

The contribution follows a standardized structure:
* inputs contains input files for tests
* src/main/java contains the following packages:
** org.softlang.company.features for implementations of [[Functional requirements]].
*** org.softlang.company.features.xom for descendants helper.
* src/test/java contains the following packages:
** org.softlang.company.tests for [[Technology:JUnit]] test cases for [[Namespace:Feature]]s.

== Usage ==

This contribution uses [[Technology:Gradle]] for building. [[Technology:Eclipse]] is supported.
