A declared name to refer to a type without introducing a new type proper

== Illustration ==

The name [[type synonym]] is specifically used in [[Language:Haskell]]. (The same concept goes by the name "typedef" in, for example, [[Language:C]].) For instance, the following Haskell declaration introduces a type synonym for salaries to be represented as floats. 

<syntaxhighlight lang="haskell">
type Salary = Float
</syntaxhighlight>

The choice of a type synonym implies that salaries and floats are compatible in a typing sense: any float is immediately acceptable whereever a salary is expected, and vice versa. The type synonym is merely a convenience without any proper effect on typing.
