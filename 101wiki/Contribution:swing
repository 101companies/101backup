== Intent ==

provide interaction on companies by means of [[Technology:Swing]]
== Motivation ==

Specifically, the GUI provides the following gestures:
* Navigate hierarchical structure of departmental nesting.
* Edit all fields of types string and number.
== Architecture ==

The implementation uses a poorman's MVC architecture.
It is based on the object model of [[Contribution:javaComposition]].
We do not assume any change-notification services on the model.
There are two views: one for departments (and companies) and another for employees.
The controller provides services that push effect of gestures into the model.
The views delegates event handlers to the controller.
The controller calls into the model and the view.
== Usage ==

Run Interaction.java to start the GUI for the sample company.
