Concerns of a [[program]] that affect other concerns

== Details ==

It is basically correct here to say "[[requirement]]" instead of "concern". [[Crosscutting concern]]s often resist to standard means of [[modularization]]. That is, [[crosscutting concern]]s make it hard to achieve [[separation of concerns]] with [[implementation]]s of [[software system]]s.
