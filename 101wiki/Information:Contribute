How to contribute to the [[@project]]

== Description ==

A guided submission page is under way to submit [[@contribution]]s for inclusion into 101repo and coverage on 101wiki. Until this page is released the following process is used: 

* Prepare your contribution following these practices:
** Use a GitHub repo under your control.
** Use a contribution name that does not clash with existing contributions.
** If you plan to host multiple contributions, then designate a subdir to each contribution.
** Do not mix contributions and other stuff; use a "contributions" dir to factor out contributions.
* "Register" your contribution with an email to 101companies@gmail.org to include these details.
** Your  name  and  email address  for contact.
** The  URL  for anonymous git-read-only access to your repo.
** The  directory  within said repo which contains your contribution.
** Details, if any, to be put on the initial contribution page on 101wiki.
* Your email will be processed by the gatekeepers of 101companies as follows:
** The contribution is reviewed in some basic manner.
** 101repo is amended to "symbolically link" to your contribution.
** An initial page is created for your contribution on the 101wiki.
** You will be notified and granted editing access to the wiki.
* You maintain your contribution in your GitHub repo.
* You document your contribution on 101wiki.
