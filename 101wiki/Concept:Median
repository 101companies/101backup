The value in the "middle" of a sorted sequence

In statistics and probability theory, the median is the numerical value separating the higher half of a data sample, a population, or a probability distribution, from the lower half. The median of a finite list of numbers can be found by arranging all the observations from lowest value to highest value and picking the middle one (eg, the median of {3, 5, 9} is 5). If there is an even number of observations, then there is no single middle value; the median is then usually defined to be the mean of the two middle values,[...] which corresponds to interpreting the median as the fully trimmed mid-range.
