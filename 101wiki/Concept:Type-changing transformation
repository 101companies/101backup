A transformation with the type of the input and output being ''not'' the same

== Details ==

In the context of [[model-driven engineering]], type-changing transformations also go by the name of [[exogenous model transformation]]s.

== Illustration ==

Diverse examples of type-changing transformations:
* A program transformation that translates one software language into another.
* A traversal over an object graph (by a visitor or otherwise) that returns objects of different classes.
* An XML transformation that replaces elements of one namespace by elements of another namespace.
* A model transformation where the metamodels of the input and output models are different.
