A [[pure IO behavior]] that extracts data from given data

== Details ==

The [[IO behavior]] is said to ''extract'' data in that it will essentially compute a result of a type of a more generic shape than the input's type. (Compare this with the concept of [[transformation]].) A query may be ''implemented'' in a [[query language]] or any [[programming language]].
