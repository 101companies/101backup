== Intent ==

this projects provides a very simple WebDSL WebApp for companies

== Motivation ==

We define pages (company/department/employee view) using the [http://webdsl.org WebDSL] DSL. 
We also provide a metamodel for companies and scenerios to [[Feature:Cut]] and [[Feature:Total]] salaries. 

=== Architecture of the project ===

"webDSL.app" is the "main file", containing the page definitions.
"company.app" holds the company model while meganalysis.app contains "meganalysis" as an instance of the model. 

== Usage ==

We make use of the WebDSL Plugin. Update Site: http://webdsl.org/page/Download

* Click "Finish"
* The project will be published on the installed server
