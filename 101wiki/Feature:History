Maintain historical company data for analysis

== Description ==

Company data is to be maintained for a number of years so that some analysis are applicable. Specifically, management is interested in the development of salaries in terms of the [[total]] and the [[median]] of salaries over the years. To this end, the data may be visualized via a [[bar chart]].

== Motivation ==

The feature triggers the need to deal with historical data, which, in a practical setting would need to be obtained by regular snapshotting or the use of a temporal database. Simple implementations of the feature may simply assume sufficient historical data via test data. More interesting implementations may also model (simulate) the process of obtaining historical data.

== Illustration ==

See [[Contribution:haskellBarchart]] for an illustration.

== Relationships ==

The feature leverages [[Feature:Total]] and [[Feature:Median]].
