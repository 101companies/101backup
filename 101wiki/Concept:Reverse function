a [[Function]] for reversing a [[list]]

== Illustration ==

[[Language:Haskell]]'s ''reverse'' function for lists works like this:

<syntaxhighlight lang="haskell">
Prelude> reverse [1,2,3]
[3,2,1]
Prelude> reverse "ABBA"
"ABBA"
</syntaxhighlight>

In the first example, reverse is applied to a list of numbers.

In the second example, reverse is applied to a string, i.e., a list of characters.

[[Language:Haskell]]'s ''reverse'' function for lists is defined like this:

<syntaxhighlight lang="haskell">
reverse :: [a] -> [a]
reverse =  foldl f []
 where f = flip (:)
</syntaxhighlight>

That is, ''reverse'' performs a left-associative [[Fold function|fold]] that composes the current element and the recursive result of folding.
We illustrate this by inlining the definition of ''foldl'' for a specific argument list:

<syntaxhighlight lang="haskell">
reverse [1,2,3] = (([] `f` 1) `f` 2) `f` 3
</syntaxhighlight>
