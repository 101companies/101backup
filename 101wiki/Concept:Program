An executable [[software artifact]] that solves a certain problem

== Description ==

According to a classic definition, a program is ([[Resource:Principles_of_information_systems]]) "a sequence of instructions written to perform a specified task with a computer". This style of definition is possibly too much focused on an imperative view of programming.

More intuitively, more inclusively, and shorter: '''a [[program]] is an executable [[software artifact]] that solves a certain problem (that is amenable to automation on a computer). For instance, a program may solve an [[algorithmic problem]].'''

A [[program]] may count as a "small" [[software system]] or an (executable) [[software component]]. A "proper" [[software system]] or [[software component|component]] typically comprises of multiple [[software artifact]]s that may be elements of different [[software language]]s, may or may not be elements of [[programming language]]s, may reside at different levels of abstraction, and may interact in various ways.

Strictly speaking, a [[program]], as far as this term is used in practice, may very well also break down into multiple [[software artifact]]s because of, for example, [[modular programming]]. Thus, the line between [[program]]s and [[software system]]s or (executable) [[software component]]s is somewhat blurred.

See the [[Hello world program]] for a very simple program.
