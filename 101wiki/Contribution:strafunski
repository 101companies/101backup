Strafunski approach generic programming in [[Language:Haskell]]

== Characteristics ==

The Strafunski approach to generic functional programming is demonstrated; see [[cites::http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-36388-2 24]] for some background. That is, based on strategy combinators for traversal and derived traversal schemes, problem-specific traversals are obtained by passing problem-specific arguments to the generic traversal schemes.

== Architecture ==

There are Haskell modules for the basic features.

* [[Feature:Hierarchical_company]]: ''Company.hs''
* [[Feature:Total]]: ''Total.hs''
* [[Feature:Cut]]: ''Cut.hs''
* [[Feature:Depth]]: 'Depth.hs''

Finally, there is a ''Main'' module which collects a few test scenarios; see below.

== Usage ==

See [[Contribution:haskellComposition]].
