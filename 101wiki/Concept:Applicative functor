Applicative functors enhance normal functors so that they enable the composition of computations, much like [[monad]]s <cite>mcbrideP08</cite>. Monads are more general but also more difficult to use than applicative functors. In particular, monadic actions may depend on the outcomes of earlier actions; this is not the case for applicative functors.
