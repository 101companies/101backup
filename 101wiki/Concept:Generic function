A [[function]] for [[datatype-generic programming]]

== Definition ==

Diverse and even conflicting definitions of "generic function" have been used in the past. The present ontology assumes the notion of generic function in the sense of [[datatype-generic programming]]. Thus, a generic function is a polymorphic function (because it can be applied to many types) that is also able to observe structure of (some of the) types in which it is parameterized.

== Illustration ==

For instance, the "[[Scrap your boilerplate]]" style of generic programming supports the definition of generic functions. See corresponding illustrations.
