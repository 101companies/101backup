What markup to use on 101wiki pages

== Description ==

Overall, 101wiki uses [[Technology:MediaWiki]] markup but with some omissions, extensions, and variations.

'''This information is under construction.'''

=== File and fragment selection ===

Files in 101repo and fragments thereof can be addressed so that the corresponding text is rendered. The following examples stem from [[Contribution:haskellStarter]]. 

This is how a complete file could be selected:

<pre>
<fragment url="/contributions/haskellStarter/src/Main.hs"/>
</pre>

In fact, the URLs can be relative to the page:

<pre>
<fragment url="src/Main.hs"/>
</pre>

A specific type in the file can be selected like this:

<pre>
<fragment url="src/Main.hs/type/Company"/>
</pre>

One can use the discovery service to actually capture the URLs for file and fragment selection. For instance, this URL positions the discovery service on the file of interest: http://101companies.org/resources/contributions/haskellStarter/src/Main.hs?format=html Accordingly, one can examine the listed fragments and extract the URLs for inclusion into the fragment markup.
