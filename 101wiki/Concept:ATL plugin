A special form of [[Language:ATL]] transformations

== Details ==

[[Language:ATL]] can create a Plugin from an ATL [[transformation]]. This plugin can then easily be reused by other implementations. The plugin is created by creating a new ATL plugin project in Eclipse. The wizard let's you then choose an existing ATL transformation. The rest is done automatically.
For using the plugin in another project, it needs to be added to the dependencies of this project.
