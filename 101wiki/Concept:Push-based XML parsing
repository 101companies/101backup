Sequential XML processing such that the input is present as an event stream to a programmer-defined handler

== Discussion ==

Such parsing provides one option of achieving [[streaming]] for XML processing. The idea is that programmer define handlers for events such as "open element", "close element", "text node", and a library sequentially processes actual XML and pushes events to the hander.
