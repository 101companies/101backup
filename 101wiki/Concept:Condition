A condition on control-flow and others

== Details ==

Conditions occur in various contexts of programming and computing. A database query may involve conditions. Imperative procedural abstractions may involve control-flow condition, preconditions, postconditions, or assertions. Equations (say, rules) in functional programming or term rewriting may involve conditions for rule selection. A UML model may involve OCL constraints.
