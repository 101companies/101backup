The namespace for [[software concept]]s

== Description ==

On this wiki, the empty namespace (i.e., no prefix) is used for software concepts. The namespace shall not have any immediate instances. Instead, specific vocabularies may express "is-a" relationships to this namespace. In this manner, all concepts are rooted by [[Namespace:Concept]] through their membership in one or more vocabularies.

== Illustration ==

[[Vocabulary:Software engineering]] is a vocabulary that indeed "is-a" sub-classifier for concepts.

[[Software system]] is a specific concept that is an "instance-of" [[Vocabulary:Software engineering]].

== Metamodel ==

* '''Headline''' (required): the headline introducing the concept.
* '''Definition''' (optional): Most concepts are readily defined elsewhere, e.g., on a Wikipedia page. In particular, when the [[Property:Identifies]] is used, then no "definition" section should be required. Otherwise, a "definition" section must be provided though.
* '''Illustration''' (optional): an illustration of the concept (or a pointer therefore).
* '''Relationships''' (optional): explanations regarding related concepts.
* '''Metadata''' (required):
** The concept must be declared to be, indeed, an instance of [[Namespace:Concept]].
** The concept should be connected with the ontology.
** The concept should be linked with online resources for identification.
** The concept should be linked with other related online resources.
