A structured collection of reusable abstractions for programming

== Details ==

Given the lack of a well-agreed and strong definition of the term "framework", some assumptions are submitted here. That is, it is assumed that a framework organizes reusable abstractions in a manner that they can be completed into an application (or a component thereof). In this context, one also speaks of inversion of control in that the framework may be in control of the application. This is to be contrasted with a simple [[library]] where the application itself remains in control such that it consistently calls library procedures when required.
