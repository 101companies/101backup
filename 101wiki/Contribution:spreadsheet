== Intent ==
Using a [[Technology:spreadsheet]] with a flat structure and formulas expressed in terms of a [[Language:spreadsheetLanguage]].

== Motivation ==


[[Technology:spreadsheet]] (e.g. [[Technology:MicrosoftExcel]], [[Technology:OpenOfficeCalc]] , or [[Technology:GoogleSpreadsheet]] are very commonly in data management.

This implementations aims to show 
* how the data model of the 101 companies can be flattened in one table
* how a trivial formulas can be used to implement the [[Feature:Sum]] and [[Feature:Cut]] features.
* how more sophisticated formulas can be used to deal with tree-based features including the [[Feature:depth]] and the [[Feature: ]] decreasing salary constraint over the hierarchy.
* how such programs provide for free a rather user interface to edit the data, and to visualize them.  
 
== Status ==
* code is stable
* preliminary documentation


== Illustration ==

== Architecture ==

== Usage ==
The file meganalysis.xls can be open either via Microsoft Excel, OpenOffice 
The file is protected so by default you can only change the data.
== Issues==
* It is assumed that names of departement (the same for person) are key, that is distinct for each other.
