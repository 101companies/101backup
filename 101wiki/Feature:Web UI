A web-based user interface

== Description ==

The feature applies when an implementation of the [[@system]] uses a Web-based user interface subject to execution in a [[Web browser]]. Such a Web-based implementation may be a self-contained local implementation or it may rely on [[distribution]] such that it accesses remote data and operations on an appropriate server; see [[Feature:Distribution]].
