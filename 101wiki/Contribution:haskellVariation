[[Data variation]] in [[Language:Haskell]] with [[algebraic data type]]s

== Characteristics ==

The [[data model]] leverages [[data variation]] for companies with departmental nesting. Thus, an [[algebraic data type]] is used for subunits of departments (i.e., employees and departments) so that recursive nesting can be expressed. The algebraic data type needs indeed two [[data constructor]]s. Thus, [[data variation]] is exercised, but see [[Contribution:haskellComposition]] for an alternative without data variation.

== Illustration ==

The data model leverages an [[algebraic data type]] for subunits of departments; in this manner recursion is enabled:

<fragment url="src/Company/Data.hs"/>    

A sample company looks like this:

<fragment url="src/Company/Sample.hs"/>    

[[Feature:Total]] is implemented as follows:

<fragment url="src/Company/Total.hs"/>

The following salary total is computed for the sample company:

<syntaxhighlight lang="haskell">
399747.0
</syntaxhighlight>

== Relationships ==

See [[Contribution:haskellComposition]] for a contribution with a similar data model such that [[data variation]] is not exercised, but only [[data composition]].

== Architecture ==

See [[Contribution:haskellComposition]].
