[[Text to Model transformation]] with [[Technology:Gra2Mol]]

== Motivation ==

A [[Text to Model transformation]] from a [[grammar]] into a [[model]] with Gra2MoL is exercised in this implementation. [[Technology:ANTLR]] is used to create a [[lexer]] and a [[parser]] based on a [[grammar]]. Then, the [[Technology:Gra2Mol]] specific rules are used to convert the parsing results into a [[model]] that conforms to a given [[Language:Ecore]] [[metamodel]].

== Illustration ==

The grammar used in the example is a normal [[Technology:ANTLR]] grammar. For example, the line for parsing companies looks like
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
company :
  'company' STRING '{' department* '}' EOF;
</syntaxhighlight>

The results of the parsing process are then converted into a model by using rules like
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
rule 'mapCompany'
	from company c
	to   Company
	queries
	  dElem : /c//#department;    
	mappings
	  name  = removeQuotes c.STRING;
	  depts = dElem;
end rule
</syntaxhighlight>
The rule takes the result "c" from the  [[Technology:ANTLR]] rule and converts it into an element of type "Company" in the resulting model. To do so, it queries all departments in "c". It then maps the String from the  [[Technology:ANTLR]] rule on the name property of the Company element. The departments "dElem" are mapped on the property "deps" of the Company element.

== Architecture ==

* The "Company.ecore" metamodel models companies (see "grammars" folder)
* transformation rules are defined in "transformation.g2m" (see "src" folder)
* The grammar used is called "Company.g" (see "grammars" folder)
* example1.101 in the directory "src" is the input file for the transformation

== Usage ==

To this end, the [http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/ Eclipse Modeling Project] or a standard Eclipse with the [http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/m2m/updates/site.xml MDE Plugin] is needed.

Steps:
* The project should be imported into Eclipse ("File" -> "Import")
* The project provides an Ant file called build.xml. This file can be used to apply the transformation. 
* Right click on the build.xml and select "Run As" -> "1 Ant build". This may fail the first time, but it should succeed the second time.

Comments:
* In order to see the output, it may be needed to refresh the Package Explorer View in Eclipse. To do that, right click on the project and choose "Refresh".
