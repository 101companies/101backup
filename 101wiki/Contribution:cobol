== Headline ==

A simple implementation in [[Language:Cobol]]

== Motivation ==

Cobol is a language that readily comes with means of data modeling and
storage (persistence). Hence, it provides a good fit for the basic features and persistence.

== Architecture ==

Directory hierarchy:
* ''programs'': main Cobol programs for sample data and features
* ''copybooks'': copybooks reused across the different programs
* ''data'': location for keyed files
* ''baselines'': baselines for automated test; see below

== Usage ==

There is a ''Makefile'' that exercises all features in some scripted order. All programs are compiled with the OpenCobol compiler (Version 1.0) and executed with its runtime.

== Issues ==

It would be interesting to provide a Cobol-like user interface.
