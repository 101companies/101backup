Tokenize 101repo files and compute some basic metrics
== Description ==
This module looks up the GeSHi code from the metadata for a file and applies GeSHi and MegaLib to extract a token sequence from the the file contents. What GeSHi considers a token for a given language is quite likely not exactly what a proper lexer for the language would consider a token. This is because GeSHi does not perform proper lexical analysis. In addition to the token sequence, this module also computes also basic metrics such as "lines of code".
