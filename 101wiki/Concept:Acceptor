== Headline ==

A program that accepts input according to some formal definition
== Illustration ==

For instance, we may implement a [[context-free grammar]] for [[parsing]], e.g., as a [[recursive descent parser]] without adding any semantic actions, though, and thereby obtain an acceptor for the language generated by the grammar. The acceptor behaves essentially as a predicate on given input: accept (true) or reject (false).
