== Headline ==

[[Object-XML mapping]] for [[Language:Java]] and [[Language:XSD]] with [[Technology:JAXB]]

== Characteristics ==

See [[Contribution:jaxbComposition]] for the overall motivation of exercising [[Technology:JAXB]] and for arguably a simple baseline of a schema and corresponding schema-derived classes. The present implementation represents an attempt to model different kinds of subunits of department (i.e., sub-departments and employees) as subtypes of a common supertype of subunits, where subtyping is meant here in the sense of XSD's type extension mechanism. The result is rather complex at both ends.

== Illustration ==

The data model is implemented as xml files (sampleCompany.xml) that conform to a schema (Company.xsd). For example departments:

<syntaxhighlight lang="xml">
<xs:complexType name="department">
 <xs:complexContent>
  <xs:extension base="subunit">
   <xs:sequence>
    <xs:element ref="name"/>
    <xs:element name="manager" type="employee"/>
    <xs:element maxOccurs="unbounded" minOccurs="0" name="subunit" type="subunit"/>
   </xs:sequence>
  </xs:extension>
 </xs:complexContent>
</xs:complexType>
</syntaxhighlight>

Actual [[Language:Java]] classes will be generated using [[Technology:xjc]].

[[Feature:Open serialization]] is implemented using [[Technology:JAXB]] Un-/Marshaller:

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Serialization.java/class/Serialization/method/deserializeCompany"/>

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Serialization.java/class/Serialization/method/serializeCompany"/>

[[Feature:Total]] and [[Feature:Cut]] are implemented as static methods:

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Total.java/class/Total"/>

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Cut.java/class/Cut"/>

Test cases are implemented for all [[Namespace:Feature]]s.

== Relationships ==

For DOM-like implementations of in-memory XML processing see [[Contribution:dom]], [[Contribution:jdom]] and [[Contribution:xom]].

For a query-based implementation of in-memory XML processing see [[Contribution:xpathAPI]].

For push-based XML processing see [[Contribution:sax]].

For Object/XML mapping see [[Contribution:jaxbChoice]] (XSD with choice for different subunits), [[Contribution:jaxbComposition]] (XSD with object composition), [[Contribution:jaxbExtension]] (XSD with type extension) and [[Contribution:jaxbSubstitution]] (XSD with substitution groups).

== Architecture ==

The contribution follows a standardized structure:
* inputs contains input files for tests
* src/main/java contains the following packages:
** org.softlang.company.features for implementations of [[Functional requirements]].
* src/test/java contains the following packages:
** org.softlang.company.tests for [[Technology:JUnit]] test cases for [[Namespace:Feature]]s.

== Usage ==

This contribution uses [[Technology:Gradle]] for building. [[Technology:Eclipse]] is supported.
