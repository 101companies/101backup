Concept for [[asynchronous communication|asynchronous]] requests in web applications

== Description ==

''Asynchronous JavaScript + XML'' <cite>ajaxJJGarrett</cite> or ''Asynchronous JavaScript and XMLHttpRequest'' <cite>schalk2007javaserver</cite> (AJAX) is a concept for [[web programming]]. The core idea is to manipulate page content ([[Language:HTML]] and [[Language:CSS]]) instead of reloading the whole page. Hence, the advantage is a more fluent interaction between user and application. The basic language for Ajax is [[Language:JavaScript]], the basic technology is [[Technology:XMLHttpRequest]]. The data exchange is handled via [[asynchronous communication]].

== Technologies ==

The main parts of AJAX are:

* [[Language:HTML]], [[Language:XHTML]], [[Language:CSS]]
* [[Technology:DOM]]
