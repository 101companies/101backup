A generalization of the [[fold function]] on lists
== Illustration ==

See the concept of [[fold algebra]]s for an illustration. (For instance, a fold for arithmetic expressions is defined over there.) See also [[Technology:Tabaluga]] for a [[generic programming]] technology that supports generalized folds. Further, see also [[Contribution:tabaluga]] for an illustration of generalized fold in the context of the [[@system]].
