A technique to build data according to variants

== Note ==

[[Data variation]] is not an established term, but it naturally arises as a generalization and dualization of existing notions that are used in [[data modeling]] and [[programming]]. Common forms of [[data variation]] are based on [[variant type]]s and [[type generalization]]. For clarity, the general term [[data variation]] is used on this wiki, whenever appropriate.

== Description ==

[[Data variation]] entails data variants, of which one must be chosen when actual data is constructed. The data variants may be specified, for example, as a [[variant type]] or as OO types related to a common base type through [[type generalization]]. [[Data variation]] may be seen as a principle means of going beyond [[data composition]].

== Illustration ==

The following [[Language:Haskell]]-based data model for the [[@system]] leverages [[data variation]] in one spot and otherwise [[data composition]]. The [[data model]] is based on [[algebraic data type]]s. The data type for subunits declare two constructors to model different types of subunits, as needed for aggregating subunits of departments.

<syntaxhighlight lang="haskell">
data Company = Company Name [Department]
data Department = Department Name Manager [SubUnit]
data Employee = Employee Name Address Salary
data SubUnit = EUnit Employee | DUnit Department
type Manager = Employee
type Name = String
type Address = String
type Salary = Float
</syntaxhighlight>

The snippet originates from [[Contribution:haskellVariation]].
