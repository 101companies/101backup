Add job roles for employees
== Description ==

The database structure shall be extended by introducing job roles for employees.
== Motivation ==

The current data structure of [[Contribution:mySqlMany]] and [[Contribution:mySqlOne]] only allows two-dimensional aggregation and analysis of data. Adding [[Feature:Job role]] enables us aggregating data multi-dimensional and therefore creating a more advanced reporting commonly used in the area of Business Intelligence (i.e. OLAP cubes).
In addition, if implemented in a normalized structure, it motivates to use more complex join queries across several tables.
== Relationships ==

* See [[Contribution:mySqlOneReporting]] for an implementation of this feature
* The present feature should be applicable to any data model of companies, specifically [[Feature:Flat company]] and [[Feature:Hierarchical_company]].
