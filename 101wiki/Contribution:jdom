== Headline ==

Process [[Language:XML|]] data with [[Language:Java|]]'s [[Technology:JDOM|]] [[API]]
== Characteristics ==

See [[Contribution:dom]] for a general motivation for exercising
[[in-memory XML processing]]. The present implementation simply exercises
yet another DOM-like API.
== Illustration ==

The data model is implemented as xml files (sampleCompany.xml) that conform to a schema (Company.xsd).

[[Feature:Parsing]] is implemented by loading a [[Technology:JDOM]] Document object:

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Parsing.java/class/Parsing/method/parseCompany"/>

[[Feature:Total]] and [[Feature:Cut]] are implemented using methods of [[Technology:JDOM]]'s Document class:

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Total.java/class/Total/method/total"/>

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Cut.java/class/Cut/method/cut"/>

Test cases are implemented for all [[Namespace:Feature]]s.
== Relationships ==

* For DOM-like implementations of in-memory XML processing see [[Contribution:dom]], [[Contribution:jdom]] and [[Contribution:xom]].
* For a query-based implementation of in-memory XML processing see [[Contribution:xpathAPI]].
* For push-based XML processing see [[Contribution:sax]].
* For Object/XML mapping see [[Contribution:jaxbChoice]] (XSD with choice for different subunits), [[Contribution:jaxbComposition]] (XSD with object composition), [[Contribution:jaxbExtension]] (XSD with type extension) and [[Contribution:jaxbSubstitution]] (XSD with substitution groups).
* [[Contribution:jdomHttp]] uses HTTP-based access to the input data instead of going through the file system.
== Architecture ==

The contribution follows a standardized structure:
* inputs contains input files for tests
* src/main/java contains the following packages:
** org.softlang.company.features for implementations of [[Functional requirements]].
* src/test/java contains the following packages:
** org.softlang.company.tests for [[Technology:JUnit]] test cases for [[Namespace:Feature]]s.
== Usage ==

This contribution uses [[Technology:Gradle]] for building. [[Technology:Eclipse]] is supported.
