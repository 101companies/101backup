== Intent ==

a very very OO implementation of the basic spec in Scala

== Motivation ==

This defines a minimal approach to realize the basic spec using Scala's OO features. In Scala terms this could be considered a ''Java without semicolons'' implementation.

== Architecture ==

The implementation features fully mutable classes and total and cut are implemented as instance methods. The implementation contains three files:

* ''Company.scala'' contains everything related to the Company entity
* ''Employee.scala'' contains classes describing the company personnel
* ''Dept.scala'' contains the implementation of Departments

== Usage ==

You need to install sbt to build and run this project as shown on the sbt [http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/wiki/Setup website]. Then change into the base directory of the project and run
 <nowiki>sbt update</nowiki>
This should fetch all needed dependencies. After that you can compile the project by typing
 <nowiki>sbt compile</nowiki>
and then
 <nowiki>sbt test</nowiki>
to run the tests.

This contribution has been tested Scala Version 2.8.1, [[Technology:sbt]] Version 0.7.4, [[Technology:sbt-idea]] Version 0.4 and [[Technology:ScalaTest]] Version 1.3.
