A technique to compose compound data from parts

== Note ==

[[Data composition]] is not an established term, but it naturally arises as a generalization of existing notions that are used in [[data modeling]] and [[programming]]. A common form of [[data composition]] is [[object composition]], which is actually sometimes also defined in a broad enough sense, not to be limited to [[object]]s in the sense of [[OO programming]]. For clarity, the general term [[data composition]] is used on this wiki, whenever appropriate.

== Description ==

[[Data composition]] entails component entities (e.g., primitive data or previously composed data) and compound entities (e.g., [[object]]s, [[tuple]]s, or [[record]]s). Composition means that the components (say, the parts) are combined to form a compound (say, a whole). A principle means of going beyond [[data composition]] is to leverage [[data variation]].

== Illustration ==

The following [[Language:Haskell]]-based data model for the [[@system]] leverages [[data composition]] systematically. The [[data model]] is based on [[algebraic data type]]s. The data types for companies, departments, and employees declare a single constructor to serve for [[data composition]]. Basic types for numbers and strings are used for some components. List types are also used.

<syntaxhighlight lang="haskell">
data Company = Company Name [Department]
data Department = Department Name Manager [Department] [Employee]
data Employee = Employee Name Address Salary
type Manager = Employee
type Name = String
type Address = String
type Salary = Float
</syntaxhighlight>

The snippet originates from [[Contribution:haskellComposition]].
