Mapping between XML types and types of a programming language

== Synonyms ==

* [[Object-XML mapping]]

== Details ==

XML data binding stands for the general notion of mediating between XML types (e.g., based on [[Language:XSD]]) and programming languages types (e.g., [[OO class]]es or [[algebraic data type]]s in [[functional programming]]). Careful, one can easily run into the O/X impedance mismatch.<ref>Ralf LÃ¤mmel and Erik  Meijer: "Revealing the X/O impedance mismatch (Changing lead into gold)". In SSDGP'06
