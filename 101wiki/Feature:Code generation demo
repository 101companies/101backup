Development of a code generation tool

== Description ==

This is a generative programming-related feature for the development and demonstration of a code-generation tool. The developed tool may support technological space travel (see the capability of [[Mapping]]) or some form of model-driven engineering. The tool is to be demonstrated by applying it to a suitable implementation of the [[@system]] so that the [[Feature:Type generation]] is covered in this manner.
