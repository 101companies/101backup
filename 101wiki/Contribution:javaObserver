== Headline ==

Implement [[Feature:Logging|logging]] my means of the [[Observer pattern|observer pattern]] in [[Language:Java]]

== Characteristics ==

The present  implementation can be viewed as a variation on [[Contribution:javaInheritance]]. 
The [[Observer pattern|observer pattern]] is applied to implement the logging of salary cutting.

== Illustration ==

The data model is implemented with [[class inheritance]]. For example Departments:

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/model/Department.java/class/Department"/>

[[Feature:Total]] and [[Feature:Cut]] are implemented as in [[Contribution:javaInheritance]]:

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Total.java/class/Total"/>

In addition the Employee class extends the "Observerable" class, implements methods for adding and notifying observers,  
and notifies them when salaries are cut:

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/model/Employee.java/class/Employee"/>

The actual [[Feature:Logging]] happens in the "EmployeeObserver": 

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/EmployeeObserver.java/class/EmployeeObserver"/>

The "update" method is called one anyone notifies the observer, leading to a logging of the new salary.

== Relationships ==


For basic OO with inheritance see [[Contribution:javaInheritance]].

== Architecture ==

The contribution follows a standardized structure:
* src/main/java contains the following packages:
** org.softlang.company.model for implementations of [[Feature:Company]].
** org.softlang.company holds the observer which implements [[Feature:Logging]].

== Usage ==

This contribution uses [[Technology:Gradle]] for building. [[Technology:Eclipse]] is supported.
