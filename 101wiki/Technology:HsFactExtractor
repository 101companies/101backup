A [[fact extractor]] for [[Language:Haskell]]

== Description ==

HsFactExtractor is a [[@technology]]; it is a [[Language:Haskell]]-specific [[fact extractor]]. HsFactExtractor extracts facts from Haskell source code. Currently, facts describe imports and names of declarations. HsFactExtractor is a simple command line tool which consumes source code through stdin and return the extracted facts through stdout using a pseudo-standardized format. That is, all declarations are listed in a "fragments" array; each declaration is classified (see "classifier" link) and its name is given (see key "name"). Currently, nested declarations (such as nested binding groups) are not supported. That is, top-level functions are listed in the output, but not local functions.
