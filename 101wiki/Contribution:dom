[[In-memory XML processing]] in [[Language:Java]] with [[Technology:DOM]]
== Characteristics ==

Companies are represented in [[Language:XML]] and the object model of [[Technology:DOM]] is used to represent and process XML documents [[In-memory XML processing|in memory]]. In particular,  operations on companies are implemented in Java on top of DOM objects. Such objects are easily queried - as needed for [[Feature:Total]]. As DOM objects also mutable, [[Feature:Cut]] is implemented as an [[impure function]].
== Illustration ==

The data model is implemented as xml files (sampleCompany.xml) that conform to a schema (Company.xsd).

[[Feature:Open serialization]] is implemented by loading and storing a [[Technology:DOM]] Document object:

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Serialization.java/class/Serialization/method/loadDocument"/>

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Serialization.java/class/Serialization/method/saveDocument"/>

[[Feature:Total]] and [[Feature:Cut]] are implemented using methods of [[Technology:DOM]]'s Document class:

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Total.java/class/Total/method/total"/>

<fragment url="src/main/java/org/softlang/company/features/Cut.java/class/Cut/method/cut"/>

Test cases are implemented for all [[Namespace:Feature]]s.

For DOM-like implementations of in-memory XML processing see [[Contribution:dom]], [[Contribution:jdom]] and [[Contribution:xom]].

For a query-based implementation of in-memory XML processing see [[Contribution:xpathAPI]].

For push-based XML processing see [[Contribution:sax]].

For Object/XML mapping see [[Contribution:jaxbChoice]] (XSD with choice for different subunits), [[Contribution:jaxbComposition]] (XSD with object composition), [[Contribution:jaxbExtension]] (XSD with type extension) and [[Contribution:jaxbSubstitution]] (XSD with substitution groups).
== Architecture ==

The contribution follows a standardized structure:
* inputs contains input files for tests
* src/main/java contains the following packages:
** org.softlang.company.features for implementations of [[Functional requirements]].
* src/test/java contains the following packages:
** org.softlang.company.tests for [[Technology:JUnit]] test cases.
== Usage ==

This contribution uses [[Technology:Gradle]] for building. [[Technology:Eclipse]] is supported.
