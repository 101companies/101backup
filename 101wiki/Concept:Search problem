The problem of determining whether a given value occurs in a given list

== Illustration ==

The problem can be described, for example, as follows:

* Input:
** A list ''l'' of values
** A value ''v''
* Output:
** ''True'': ''v'' occurs in ''l''.
** ''False'': otherwise.

This is an [[algorithmic problem]] because one can obviously define an [[algorithm]] to iterate over the elements of ''l'' and to check for an occurrence of ''v'' along the way. This simple idea is the foundation for [[linear search]]. When additional constraints are imposed on the input, then search may also be more efficient; see [[binary search]] for example.
