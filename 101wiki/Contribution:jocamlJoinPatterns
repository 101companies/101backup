A [[Language:JoCaml|JoCaml]]-based implementation that uses [[join patterns]]

== Motivation == 

Nowadays, [[event handling]] is a standard technique in GUI programming. However, 
there is a lot of research going on to use such an [[event handling|event-based]] 
approach for [[concurrency|concurrent programming]]. The idea is to [[Parallelism|parallelize]] 
the [[event handling|handling of events]] by combining simple [[events]] to 
more complex ones using so called [[join patterns]]. This project demonstrates 
the usage of [[concurrency]] by [[event handling]] in JoCaml using such 
[[join patterns]].

== Illustration ==

[[Join patterns]] combine several [[events|event]] [[channels]], which all must be 
served in order to start the [[event handling|handling]]. If [[channels]]
represent functions on an object-like strucure another [[channels|channel]] is often used
as a internal [[state]], which is modified by the function.  

 <nowiki>
(* join pattern for cut *) 
def employeeState (n, a, s) & cut () = 
    employeeState (n, a, s *. 0.5)
</nowiki>

For example the internal state ''employeeState (n, a, s)'' describes an employee 
with name, address and salary. If a [[Feature:Cut]]-[[Events|event]] 
occurs this internal [[state]] is consumed and triggered again with a modified 
salary.

== Architecture ==

* ''company.ml'' company structure
* ''company.mli'' header, company signature
* ''meganalysis.ml'' sample company
* ''main.ml'' simple test program

== Usage ==

You need to install J[[Language:JoCaml|JoCaml]] . 

Use the [[Technology:GNU make|makefile]] for some demo:
* Enter ''make compile'' to compile the code
* Enter ''make test'' to execute the script contained in ''main.ml'' and to perform a simple [[Technology:diff|diff-based]] test
