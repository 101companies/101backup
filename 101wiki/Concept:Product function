compute the product of a list of numbers

== Illustration ==

In Haskell, there is a corresponding [[Prelude module]] function as follows:

<syntaxhighlight lang="haskell">
Prelude> product [1..5]
120
</syntaxhighlight>

For what it matters, this function can be defined as a [[Fold function|fold]] as follows:

<syntaxhighlight lang="haskell">
Prelude> let product = foldr (*) 1
Prelude> product [1..5]
120
</syntaxhighlight>
