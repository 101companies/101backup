Use of [[record type]]s in [[Language:Haskell]]
== Characteristics ==

A data model for flat companies is defined in terms of Haskell's [[record type]]s. Such record types are essentially [[algebraic data type]]s. We only use record types for compound data. Otherwise, we use Haskell's [[newtype]]s, which is a special form of algebraic data type. Other than that, the contribution is a simple variation on [[Contribution:haskellData]] which uses plain algebraic data types for all types.
== Illustration ==

The data model looks like this:

<fragment url="src/Company/Data.hs"/>    

A sample company looks like this:

<fragment url="src/Company/Sample.hs"/>    

[[Feature:Total]] is implemented as follows:

<fragment url="src/Company/Total.hs"/>

The present contribution is a variation on [[Contribution:haskellData]] and thus in turn on [[Contribution:haskellEngineer]].
