== Headline ==
abstract module to apply rules to files

== Description ==

Apply the rules gathered by [[Module:rules101meta]] to specified files. This module is abstract and it can not be called directly but is rather used a library for other modules to apply rules to the file system. It could also be used by non-modules as it is independent from the path it is called from. It implements the whole new api, including fpredicates. It can be called in append or overwrite/create mode.

== Output ==

One file per input ".metadata.json"

== Usage ==

The most important function of this module is: 
<syntaxhighlight lang="python" source="program.py">

def apply_rules(files, rules, filter_function, append):
    # code omitted
    pass

</syntaxhighlight>

The application works like this:

<syntaxhighlight lang="python" source="program.py">

apply_rules(['/tmp/antlrParser/contributions/antlrParser/src/file.java'], rules, lambda rule: not any(filter(lambda key: key in ('predicate', 'fpredicate', 'content', 'locator'), rule['rule'].keys())), append=False)

</syntaxhighlight>

The third predicate is a filter function to filter out rules, it is advised to use this parameter instead doing this by hand.
