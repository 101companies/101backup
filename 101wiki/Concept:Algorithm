(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm, 14 April 2013)

In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm [...] is a step-by-step procedure for calculations. Algorithms are used for calculation, data processing, and automated reasoning.

More precisely, an algorithm is an effective method expressed as a finite list [...] of well-defined instructions [...] for calculating a function. [...] Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty), [...] the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite [...] number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing "output" [...] and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.
