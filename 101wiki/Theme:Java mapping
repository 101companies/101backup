[[Language:Java]] theme of implementations that travel technological spaces

== Description ==

Subject to appropriate bridges, i.e., subject to [[Mapping|mapping]] facilities, any programming language can be made to access and process [[model]]s, [[Language:XML]], relational database [[table]]s, and [[text]] (concrete syntax) in a type-based (say, schema-aware or metamodel-aware or grammar-aware) manner. The present theme collects corresponding implementations for the programming language [[Language:Java]].
