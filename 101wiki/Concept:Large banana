[[Generalized fold]]s for system of [[algebraic data type]]s

== Illustration ==

A [[data model]] for companies of the [[@system]] requires a system of [[algebraic data type]]s such as follows:

<fragment url="/contributions/tabaluga/src/Company/Data.hs/data/Company"/>

<fragment url="/contributions/tabaluga/src/Company/Data.hs/data/Department"/>

<fragment url="/contributions/tabaluga/src/Company/Data.hs/data/Employee"/>

Thus, a [[generalized fold]] for companies also needs to be parameterized in multiple types: one for each type in the system:

<fragment url="/contributions/tabaluga/src/Company/Algebra.hs/data/CompanyAlgebra"/>

We can set up some interesting baseline behavior on companies. The following algebra models deep identity over companies such that the company structure is fully traversed and rebuilt:

An operation for cutting salaries in half can now be derived from ''mapCompany'' simply by record update such that the case for employees realizes salary cut:

<fragment url="/contributions/tabaluga/src/Company/Cut.hs/pattern/cut"/>
