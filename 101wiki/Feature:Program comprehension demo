Development of a tool for program comprehension

== Description ==

This is a reverse engineering-related feature for the development and demonstration of a tool for API-related program comprehension. The developed tool serves the analysis of an implementation's sources or other artifacts in terms of [[API]] usage, i.e., the usage of API elements such as types and methods. Of course, the exact analysis also depends on the underlying programming paradigm and platform.

== Example ==

For instance, consider a Java-based implementation that uses APIs. We assume that API types are all those referenced types that are not defined in Java code, but they are only available in .jar form. One may be interested in overall API usage as follows. All API packages are to be determined. All used (i.e., referenced) types per API package are to be determined. All used (i.e., invoked) methods per used API type are to be determined. The results may be summarized in tables (.csv) or visualized in some manner.
