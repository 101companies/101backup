== Intent ==

demonstrate Kiama

== Motivation ==

Kiama provides several advanced programming concepts:
context-sensitive attribute equations, circular attribute equations,
rewrite rules and higher-order rewriting strategies.  The present
implementation puts to work some of them for the benefit of a
declarative and concise implementation of the 101companies system.

== Usage ==

Use the simple-build-tool to build: sbt script for Unix and MacOSX and
sbt.bat script for Windows.

(One time only) Download Scala compiler and needed libraries:

<pre>
$ ./sbt update
</pre>

This downloads and installs the relevant jars in your project, so you
need to be on the net for it to work. 

The remaining steps can be performed without a net connection.

To compile the project (if necessary) and run the main program:

<pre>
$ ./sbt run
399747.0
199873.5
3
</pre>

To run the tests with logging:

<pre>
$ ./sbt info test
</pre>
