A validator for Java

== Description ==

JValidator is a [[@technology]]; it is a Java-specific validator. JValidator essentially parses the source code; it does not attempt compilation; it does not enforce any static semantics rules. Zero exit code is to be interpreted as successful validation; non-zero exit code as failure.
