== Headline ==

[[Language:SQL]]-based implementation tailored to [[Technology:MySQL]]

== Motivation ==

To extend the data base structure of [[Contribution:mySqlOne]] by implementing [[Feature:Dimensionality]].

A [[relational schema]] is used as the [[data model]] of the [[@system]]. Some [[functional requirement]]s of the system are modelled as [[Language:SQL]] statements.

== Illustration ==
'' ERM of source database schema ''

== Relationships ==

* See [[Contribution:mySqlOne]] which implements the base structure used in [[Contribution:mySqlOneReporting]]
* See [[Contribution:mySqlMany]] for a variation of the base structure which supports many companies instead a single company. The two variants are used for illustrating [[Feature:Singleton]] and [[Feature:Many companies]].

== Usage ==

=== Requirements ===
* MySQL Client >= 5.0
* MySQL Server >= 5.0

Create the database(s):

=== Installation ===

<pre>
    $ mysql> CREATE DATABASE onereporting;
</pre>
'' NOTE: Grant privileges in case you donÂ´t want to use the root user. ''
'' You can use "n" source databases. ''

Load database schema:

<pre>
    $ mysql -u <USERNAME> -p -h <HOSTNAME> onereporting < sql/schema.sql
</pre>

OPTIONAL: Populate the databases using sample data:
<pre>
    $ mysql -u <USERNAME> -p -h <HOSTNAME> onereporting < sql/sample.sql
</pre>
