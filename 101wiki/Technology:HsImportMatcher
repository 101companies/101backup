an import matcher for Haskell

== Description ==

HsImportMatcher is a part of [[101companies:Explorer]]; it is a Haskell-specific tool for import matching. That is, the technology supports the syntax-aware proof of using a certain Haskell-based technology in terms of its import into Haskell sources. The input/output behavior of HsImportMatcher is the following:

* Input:
** a Haskell module
** a namespace (a string)
* Output:
** None
* Exit:
** Normal: successful matching
** Abnormal: failed matching (or other problems)

== Illustration ==

Consider this technology tagging:

<pre>
$ pwd
/home/me/projects/101repo
$ more technologies/HXT/.tetala 
[
 { 
  "language" : "Haskell",
  "namespace" : "Text.XML.HXT"
 }
]
</pre>

Hence, [[Technology:HXT]] is said to be detectable due to the associated namespace "Text.XML.HXT". More operationally, any Haskell module could be scanned for "imports" to refer to said namespace. For instance, [[Contribution:haskellHxt]] does indeed make good use of [[Technology:HXT]]. Thus, the test case:

<pre>
$ pwd
/home/me/projects/101repo/technologies/HsImportMatcher
$ make test
$ more Makefile 
build:
...
test:
...
        @./matcher.py \
                ../../contributions/hxt/Total.hs \
                "Text.XML.HXT"
...
</pre>
