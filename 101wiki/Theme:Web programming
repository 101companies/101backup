[[Web programming]] theme of implementations 

== Description ==

There is a myriad of web-programming frameworks. This theme features implementations that demonstrate arguably the most established frameworks, while at the same time aiming at coverage of different languages and platforms. For instance, [[Technology:Silverlight]] may currently count as a major web-programming approach for the [[Technology:.NET]] platform, and hence, an implementation was included. Also, [[Language:PHP]] is generally popular for web development, and hence, an implementation based on the popular [[Technology:Pyjamas]] framework was included. As far as [[Language:Java]] is concerned, there are again, in turn, many different approaches and frameworks, and the goal was here to select a small number of different and popular approaches. Finally, in the case of [[Language:HTML5]], the two options of a local applications versus a client/server architecture is demonstrated.
